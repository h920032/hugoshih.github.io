Imagine a scenario in the industrial field where a part of a machine suddenly malfunctions and needs to stop all motor operations in a very short time. If a traditional operating system like Linux is used, depending on the OS kernel scheduling policy, the action of stopping the motor may be slightly delayed. In contrast, an RTOS can have more flexible thread preemption, allowing emergency situations to be handled faster.</p><p>Essentially, the kernel usage of RTOS is similar. Basically, they can achieve multiple thread creation, round-robin execution, priority preemption, mutex locks, kernel-level interrupts, etc. More advanced ones have dynamic memory management and multi-core support. The main differences between these RTOS lie in the support for peripheral modules and the surrounding development ecosystem. The following introduces several currently mainstream common RTOS:</p><h3 id=freertos><a class=link href=https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS target=_blank rel=noopener>FreeRTOS</a></h3><p>FreeRTOS is maintained by Real Time Engineers Ltd. and Amazon. It is completely open source and widely used globally. FreeRTOS can be said to be the most common RTOS. Its success lies in being open source early, integrated by various IDEs early, and its shadow can be seen in the SDKs of various chips. I first contacted it in the Arduino IDE. FreeRTOS appeared in the Arduino library list very early. It is simple enough to use, without complex settings, and multi-threading can be implemented with a line or two of code, making it easy for beginners to enter the world of RTOS. Its backer is Amazon, and later it also integrated a lot of AWS IoT-related functions. Since it was open sourced early, there are many surrounding modules.</p><h3 id=azurertos-threadx><a class=link href=https://github.com/eclipse-threadx/threadx target=_blank rel=noopener>AzureRTOS (Threadx)</a></h3><p>ThreadX is a real-time operating system (RTOS) developed by Express Logic. It was subsequently acquired by Microsoft and released as a renamed version AzureRTOS and open sourced. From the name, it can be seen that formerly it should be paired with Microsoft&rsquo;s Azure to do some IoT functions, but currently, no killer application seems to have been seen. Because it was open sourced relatively late, there are fewer surrounding packages, such as BLE and Wifi stacks, but I believe with native support from Microsoft, it should grow quickly. I encountered AzureRTOS because STM32 officially supports AzureRTOS natively. Interestingly, the STM32 development environment also supports FreeRTOS, but the support is far inferior to AzureRTOS.</p><h3 id=zephyr><a class=link href=https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr target=_blank rel=noopener>Zephyr</a></h3><p>Zephyr is an open-source real-time operating system (RTOS) led by the Linux Foundation. Although Zephyr has been around for a long time, it has only suddenly become popular in recent years. It features cross-platform compatibility and a complete development toolchain, with useful tools like West and architectures designed for cross-platform like DeviceTree. It can be said that to use Zephyr, you have to use this entire toolchain together to make it useful. However, it seems that due to the toolchain and compatibility reasons, although various chip manufacturers claim support, the support doesn&rsquo;t seem to be that good, especially when it comes to very low-level hardware settings (like clock tree settings), it becomes particularly troublesome. if there is no such requirement, it is quite easy to use, and many settings and initializations are omitted for you. I encountered Zephyr because I used Nordic&rsquo;s Bluetooth SoC. The latest nrf connect SDK is basically built on Zephyr, and Zephyr&rsquo;s communication-related packages are also very complete, making it very suitable for Nordic chips.</p><h3 id=rt-thread><a class=link href=https://github.com/RT-Thread/rt-thread target=_blank rel=noopener>RT-Thread</a></h3><p>RT-Thread is an open-source real-time operating system (RTOS) led by a Chinese team. It is quite popular in China&rsquo;s embedded system open source community and has good support for Chinese-made MCUs (especially some RISC-V chips), but it is rarely seen used elsewhere. Like Zephyr, there are many tools available. I haven&rsquo;t used it myself yet, but what impressed me was that the RT-Thread community has a tool that can generate STM32 bootloader with one click. However, to use it, you need to register an account, and it is limited to registration with a Chinese phone number&mldr;, which is not very friendly to developers outside of China.</p><h2
