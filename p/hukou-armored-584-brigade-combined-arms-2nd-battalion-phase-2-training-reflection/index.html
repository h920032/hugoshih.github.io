It has been four months since I left 584 Brigade <em>(2022/10/26~2023/01/06)</em>. As time goes by, memories of the army fade away little by little. It is time to record memories of this period.</p><h2 id=preface>Preface</h2><p>This story probably starts from drawing lots at the tail of boot camp. People interested in boot camp experience can read my previous article. Still remember when drawing lots everyone calculated various drawing techniques. Like analyzing units left in lot cylinder. Touching which direction of lot cylinder easier to get good lot etc. Because this batch are all Taipei soldiers. Relatively good lots like Guandu Area Command, Reserve Command etc. units around Taipei. These units easiest to go home on holiday. Bad ones like Matsu Defense Command, Hualien Defense Command these places very troublesome to go home. And like <em>21 Artillery</em>, <em>584 Brigade</em> are group not up not down. And unfortunately this part of lots are the most. And I just happened to draw <strong>584 Brigade Supply Soldier</strong>.</p><p>Before going down to unit everyone inquired various information related to drawn unit from squad leader, battalion commander. And 584 is probably that kind of mediocre. Tank battalion, combat unit might be very tired. Food might be good. Sound like not particularly cool unit. Located in Hsinchu Hukou although very close to freeway. But not very easy to go home either. But thinking still have worse Hualien Defense Command. Psychologically more passable.</p><p>Second day back from boot camp leave. Under mutual farewell of boot camp peers; Carrying heavy Yellow Pu bag and terrible convenience store bread. Sat on bus to 584 Brigade. Actually still one boot camp same bed also drew this unit. Plus same company also had dozen people. This journey not lonely. Bus departed from Taichung Chenggong Ridge at ten something in morning. Three four hours later drove into Hukou camp area. Started my life in 584 Brigade.</p><h2 id=about-phase-2-life>About Phase 2 Life</h2><p>Phase 2 life and boot camp are worlds apart. Boot camp had no freedom. While phase 2 had partial freedom. For example: mobile phone. Having mobile phone gave me bit more spiritual solace to survive remaining two and half months.</p><h3 id=tortuous-entry>Tortuous Entry</h3><p>When big bus from Chenggong Ridge slowly drove into camp area in Hukou we thought already arrived our new home. Actually this journey just started. When arrived bus stopped at a assembly ground of 542 Brigade camp area. Watching peers of other buses get off one after another. Doubt started in heart isn&rsquo;t already arrived? About waited ten minutes bus started again. Wonderful thing happened. Bus actually slowly drove out of camp area. At this time suddenly remembered: Hukou has several camp areas. We should be going to another camp area right. Sure enough few minutes later we arrived at 584 Brigade camp area located on other side of Hukou. Came into view are old houses and cafeteria similar to Chenggong Ridge. Can&rsquo;t help OS in heart: where are agreed new barracks&mldr; After stopping we were called off bus to gather at cafeteria. And started assigning units. Also simultaneously observing where called people go. Avoided waiting another period of time finally turn to us. After called out originally thought would walk to our barracks. Result we were arranged to get on a medium tactical vehicle. Followed by confusing situation happened again. We actually left camp area again. At this time suddenly remembered seems officer said 584 Brigade also has a camp area in Taoyuan. Heart shocked: no way, we going to Taoyuan!?</p><p>Medium tactical vehicle drove slowly. Slowly passed through alleys of Hukou. About passed 20 minutes. Medium tactical vehicle drove into a place never thought of: <strong>Army Northern Assessment Center</strong>. When drove into main gate still couldn&rsquo;t help looking at lot in hand. I drew 584 Brigade that&rsquo;s right. Have to say first impression of Northern Assessment Center is good. Here no gray black houses or camouflage bunkers. Instead red appearance building and large piece of neat beautiful lawn. Compared to army camp here more like a school. Really glad assigned here. No need to endure camp barracks broken to no good like Chenggong Ridge anymore. Later explained by officer. Due to historical factor of 584 Brigade. Combined Arms 2nd Battalion we assigned to temporarily reside in Northern Assessment Center.</p><div align=center><img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.tM-9BhYUNHeOLauZLKaQdgHaFj?pid=ImgDet&w=640&h=480&rs=1" width=60% alt="Image description"> Appearance of Medium Tactical Vehicle</div><h3 id=about-584-brigade>About 584 Brigade</h3><blockquote><p>Army unit of Republic of China guarding Hsinchu County Taiwan. Assigned to Army 6th Corps Command. Armored 584 Brigade team name &ldquo;Dengbu Unit&rdquo;. Predecessor is Army Infantry 284th Division. Before dissolving in Jing-Shi Case this division long term stationed in Kinmen Nanxiong defense area. Therefore also known as &ldquo;Nanxiong Division&rdquo;.</p></blockquote><p>Armored 584 Brigade. From name know we are an armored vehicle unit. So besides general military vehicles. Unit also has very many armored vehicles and tanks. Armored vehicle mainly responsible for transporting infantry to combat location. Sometimes also provide small amount firepower support. Tank mainly responsible for outputting firepower. Because armored unit here. Every day can hear sound of tanks circling in camp area. Quite spectacular.</p><div align=center><img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.4f4653c90d412957ac115b26b15d7a28?rik=Dzu0TwJPxsbKBQ&pid=ImgRaw&r=0" width=60% alt="Image description"> This is armored vehicle</div><p>584 Brigade has another name. Called <strong>&ldquo;Dengbu&rdquo; Unit</strong>. Legend during Civil War once won battle at Dengbu Island along coast of China. Later awarded name Dengbu. From here also can see 584 Brigade is unit full of history. During service period happened to encounter team anniversary. By the way visited team history museum. Is very special experience. Also deeper understanding of National Army. 584 Brigade also very solid unit. Before coming to Hukou unit stationed in Kinmen. Located at first line of defense. Requirement for combat power very high. And in 80s of Republic era only transferred back to Taiwan stationed in Hsinchu Hukou due to various reasons. Before coming Hukou was originally military important place. Have several brigades stationed here quite crowded. And 584 Brigade considered new neighbor. Therefore only can disperse parasitic in several camp areas of Hukou.</p><p>Battalion I am in called <strong>&ldquo;Combined Arms 2nd Battalion&rdquo;</strong>. Due to various reasons currently stationed in Army Northern Assessment Center. This place is used for testing combat power. Therefore often see many units lead team come here conduct combat, physical fitness etc. tests. Northern Assessment Center located on Shengli Road Hukou. Most Hukou people should know one side of Shengli Road from north to south all military camps. To arrive here not as easy as Chenggong Ridge. Chenggong Ridge very close to High Speed Rail station. Five minutes drive. Even can arrive by walking. And Hukou camp area distance Hsinchu High Speed Rail station at least twenty minutes drive. Closer station is Hukou Train Station. But speed not as fast as High Speed Rail. After coming out from Hsinchu High Speed Rail station just say to driver want go to first encountered camp area on Shengli Road (but formal name is Hukou 4th Camp Area) fine. Journey will pass section of tortuous climbing. Finally turn onto Shengli Road Hukou. From High Speed Rail station to camp area easier. But from camp area to High Speed Rail station very troublesome. Most time cannot call car. Even called might have to wait twenty thirty minutes. For obligatory service only few holidays want rush back Taipei not very friendly.</p><div align=center><img src=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/584r.png width=30% alt="Image description"></div><p>Dengbu Team Emblem<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup></p><h3 id=troop-type-and-unit-allocation>Troop Type and Unit Allocation</h3><p>Our batch threw to 584 Brigade roughly have following troop types: <em>Rifleman, Clerk, Supply Soldier, Driver</em>. Then what relationship these troop types have with doing things in phase 2? <strong>Answer is completely no relationship</strong>. Care you drew what soldier. Even if name very handsome 66 rocket soldier arrived phase 2 unit later all are <strong>Rifleman</strong>. Mainly we in boot camp stage also only received rifle training. So only can operate rifle.</p><p>Although said all riflemen. But doing things still somewhat different. And mainly related to assigned unit. You will be assigned to what unit irrelevant to drawn troop type. Purely related to company at time of boot camp. I guess they probably just purely arranged according to unit personnel demand. Therefore boot camp same company people arrived 584 Brigade later also big chance will be in same battalion and same company. Like at boot camp my company was <strong>Firepower Company</strong>. And most people in Firepower Company who drew to 584 Brigade later also assigned to Combined Arms 2nd Battalion <strong>Combat Support Company</strong>. Only few people assigned to Combined Arms 2nd Battalion Firepower Company next door. Things done in phase 2 largely related to nature of company. In Combined Arms 2nd Battalion there are companies purely providing firepower like: Firepower Company, Combat 1st Company, Combat 2nd Company&mldr; Also have purely support nature Combat Support Company. Combat Support Company responsible for support work during combat. Besides offensive firepower support also provide like food, medical, communication, maintenance related support. In terms of daily life companies purely providing firepower train more. And Combat Support Company miscellaneous things more. Can be assigned to Combat Support Company is lucky. Every time seeing people of other companies move guns ammunition out prepare war everyday evening move back. Will feel better just do miscellaneous things.</p><p>Since Combat Support Company support affairs many. Therefore internal divided into several platoons. Each platoon responsible for one business (food, medical, communication, maintenance). And platoon I assigned called <strong>Battalion Headquarters Platoon</strong>. Mainly assisting battalion officers handle various miscellaneous things. I in period contacted like help officer serve food, clean hygiene, photocopy data, build command post etc. Not considered very heavy difficult work. However because will contact battalion officer first line. Doing things how to make battalion officer happy is very important.</p><h3 id=phase-2-must-bring-things>Phase 2 Must Bring Things</h3><p>Phase 2 suddenly much more can do own things. Life no longer simple like boot camp. Therefore much more demands.</p><h4 id=consumption>Consumption</h4><ul><li><input disabled type=checkbox> <strong>Small Change</strong> - Phase 2 will suddenly have many opportunities can use money. You will have lot of time can go to camp store (basically rest time can go. As long as camp store opens). Camp store besides various snacks drinks let you feel beauty of outside world. Also hot food section. If don&rsquo;t want eat lunch provided by kitchen can also try fried noodles, braised pork rice, fried chicken leg of camp store. These mostly pay cash. Bring one two hundred yuan few days will spend. In addition some squad leaders very nice to voluntary service. Also willing help obligatory service take out outside food. You think yesterday eat KFC today eat Pizza hut. This is thing completely unimaginable when new recruit.</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> <strong>EasyCard with Automatic Reload</strong> - That kind integrated EasyCard is simply Doraemon&rsquo;s magic tool. Besides partial vending machines can use. Camp store, or further walk to OK convenience store in 542 Brigade camp area can use EasyCard. Buy whatever want buy. Very convenient.</li></ul><h4 id=food>Food</h4><ul><li><input disabled type=checkbox> <strong>Instant Noodles</strong> - When your action range expand to whole Hukou camp area. Almost no daily necessities cannot buy. Instant noodles same logic. However if have specific flavor want eat still can bring in from outside beforehand stock. Late night making cup noodle in dormitory really evil. Occasionally take instant noodle honor officer build relationship also can exchange little bit relax.</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> <strong>Snacks</strong> - Same logic. Most snacks also can buy. Most time you will lazy walk so far go buy things. So bring in early stock more convenient. Also can sell to neighbor.</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> <strong>Drinks</strong> - Drink choices in camp area less. And still have many that kind strange drinks completely never seen outside. Relatively that kind tetra pak drink choice also less. Only OK has small amount. If want drink specific models also suggest bring back when returning from holiday.</li></ul><h4 id=clothing>Clothing</h4><ul><li><input disabled type=checkbox> <strong>Jacket</strong> - Usually training time cannot wear own jacket. Except morning assembly and exercise time. My phase 2 time is November to January. This period Hsinchu wind big and cold. Really need have a warm jacket. New recruit issued white green jacket really sucks. If entering camp in winter must bring.</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> <strong>Warm Clothing</strong> - Enter camp in winter must bring. Especially weather particularly cold few days night sleeping really will be cold protect. So some thick long pants or thermal underwear very necessary.</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> <strong>Sneakers</strong> - Phase 2 exercise time also can wear own sneakers. So if feel issued shoes hard to wear or worn out. Then can also bring own sneakers in.</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> <strong>Sport Shorts</strong> - Boot camp sport shorts only issued one. Because wear shorts every day. So usually wash once a week very disgusting. Phase 2 exercise time can wear own shorts. Usually can prevent one pants wear several days situation. Own pants also more comfortable.</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> <strong>Laundry Powder</strong> - Boot camp wash clothes is clothes to wash use laundry bag concentrate find outside vendor unify send wash. Phase 2 due to such demand not big. Default is directly use washing machine on camp wash self. Then of course laundry powder part have to bring self. However our phase 2 peer obligatory service more. Discussed with officer want unify send wash. So later officer also help us find vendor handle. No need self grab washing machine someone help wash good really convenient.</li></ul><h4 id=tableware>Tableware</h4><ul><li><input disabled type=checkbox> <strong>Bowl</strong> - Phase 2 finish restaurant tableware will unify recycle keep. Phase 2 bowls plates etc. self keep. If feel meal tray provided by camp hard use, hard wash. Can also bring big bowl self. Loading dish loading rice will convenient much.</li></ul><h4 id=bedding>Bedding</h4><ul><li><input disabled type=checkbox> <strong>Quilt</strong> - Folding quilt definitely most painful thing when soldier wake up. Boot camp requirement for quilt high strive for edges and corners. Spend twenty thirty minutes folding quilt not exaggeration. Phase 2 no longer will have officer want you must spread quilt. Or you basically can directly cover own quilt. Daytime put back quilt completely never spread. Own quilt stuff back into internal affairs cabinet.</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> <strong>Many Power Banks</strong> - Our company rule is night can use extension cord connect phone charger charge. But daytime only use power bank charge. Never underestimate phone usage. Since too boring in camp area. One day phone usage time is ten hours start. Naturally power bank also carry along. Usually have two power banks can ensure everyday at least one power bank has electricity.</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> <strong>Power Adapter</strong> - Want charge phone or power bank then of course need that kind 110v to type-c adapter. Best bring few more backup avoid missing.</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> <strong>Wired Earphone</strong> - In army principle cannot bring bluetooth earphone. Only can bring wired earphone. Phase 2 earphone also use anytime. Besides talk phone with family girlfriend use. Bored want low profile watch drama, watch youtube also very useful. Just wear earphone in training time be sure low profile. Seen by officer still will angry. Also earphone also suggest <em>bring few more</em>. Since usage chance many. Broken chance also many. I in camp area had accidentally pull break one. Again no prepare backup. Cause that week want talk phone or watch video become very troublesome.</li></ul><h4 id=medicine>Medicine</h4><ul><li><input disabled type=checkbox> <strong>Cold Medicine</strong> - Once arrive phase 2 suddenly become easily catch cold. Possibly chance stay in closed space with neighbor increase. When catch cold although Northern Assessment Center has infirmary. But medical officer quite useless. Besides prescribe some comprehensive cold medicine only will transfer. So if symptom not too serious then eat cold medicine self fine.</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> <strong>Mosquito Repellent</strong> - Phase 2 officer also won&rsquo;t require you must hang mosquito net. Although night sleep window will close. But inevitably have mosquito sneak in and drive not away. At this time only can rely on mosquito repellent or some anti-itch medicine.</li></ul><h3 id=daily-schedule>Daily Schedule</h3><p>Compared to boot camp every link planned well. Phase 2 life relatively much flexible. Except assembly time very fixed. Daily assembly time, rest time, eating time not that fixed. Mostly will different according to daily training, business content. Compared boot camp that kind every minute every second very critical life. Phase 2 really pressure small much. Daily schedule roughly as follows:</p><ul><li><em>06:00</em> <strong>Wake Up</strong> - Our phase 2 time is according to winter time. Wake up time compare summer time 05:30 can have 30 minutes more sleep time. Phase 2 unlike boot camp will wake up earlier 30 minutes. Anyway requirement for quilt not high. Morning about spend ten minutes can settle quilt and wash.</li><li><em>06:20</em> <strong>Assembly</strong> - After wash can slowly move to assembly ground assemble. This assembly wear usual exercise uniform fine. Unlike boot camp only obligatory service assemble. Yesterday duty stay obligatory service will also assemble. Watching obligatory service also look sleepy very interesting. This assembly is duty squad leader roughly look person missing or not. Not missing squad leader mood good bring everyone do some exercise. But most time directly release everyone go down eat breakfast. Suggest steal bowl chopsticks stuff into pocket bring down when assemble. So no need run back dormitory one more trip.</li><li><em>06:00 ~ 06:30</em> <strong>Eat Breakfast</strong> - Compared to boot camp too many people restaurant cannot sit. Phase 2 after breakfast time restaurant super empty. Voluntary service have outside eating sleeping rarely come in eat breakfast. We obligatory service sometimes also want go back steal sleep. Also not necessarily want eat. 584 Brigade breakfast beginning come very delicious. Later don&rsquo;t know why worse and worse. Only left steamed bun, few small dishes, porridge, and sweet soup. Mediocre.</li><li><em>07:30</em> <strong>Assembly</strong> - This assembly want full gear (helmet, S-belt). Then will conduct singing counting numbers. That is first come few singing counting numbers. Then lead sing military song like &ldquo;Army in Charge&rdquo;.</li><li><em>07:30 ~ 11:00</em> <strong>Training Class</strong> - See what schedule of day is. Since our unit experiencing pre-base training. Therefore quite a lot training content targeting down base like CPR, combat injury rescue, night vision goggles etc. Mainly still train voluntary service. Obligatory service beside fill number. No class then maintain gun in Zhongshan room or slide phone be redundant. Occasionally called out help.</li><li><em>11:00 ~ 12:00</em> <strong>Lunch</strong> - Different from boot camp. Lunch before no longer assemble. Just after class respective return dormitory unload gear take bowl chopsticks then self go restaurant eat. Finish eat self return rest. Lunch compared boot camp quite good. Usually have two to three main dishes. Then dish amount also very sufficient. Won&rsquo;t have dish not enough situation in boot camp. In addition one sweet one salty soup can choose. Sometimes have add dish. Can eat something different like hot pot.</li><li><em>12:00 ~ 13:30</em> <strong>Nap</strong> - Nap just return dormitory rest sleep. Don&rsquo;t mess do whatever want do. No one will care you.</li><li><em>13:30</em> <strong>Assembly</strong> - Same also full gear. Again one more time singing counting numbers. Sometimes noon have duty (wash meal bucket kind work) can makeup rest until two o&rsquo;clock. Can upstairs dormitory steal listen downstairs how this military song sing. Obligatory service since often practice all can sing. But voluntary service since usually busy all not quite can sing. Overall depend on obligatory service pull high average value otherwise will be scolded by battalion duty officer.</li><li><em>14:10 ~ 16:00</em> <strong>Training Class</strong> - Continue doing things similar to morning.</li><li><em>16:00 ~ 17:00</em> <strong>Exercise</strong> - Different from boot camp. Phase 2 has exercise time. Sometimes company commander mood good will come lead physical training. Otherwise usually run then go basketball court play ball. Really quite healthy life. Later I and few peers will long run to 542 camp area together. About three kilometers. Way back drop by Hi-Life steal buy something.</li><li><em>17:00 ~ 18:00</em> <strong>Dinner</strong> - Eating same things as lunch. However voluntary service since have outside eating sleeping. So people eat not many.</li><li><em>18:00 ~ 19:00</em> <strong>Washing Up</strong> - See you want wash bath this time or not. Not wash later also have chance. Not anxious.</li><li><em>19:00</em> <strong>Assembly</strong> - This assembly only assemble obligatory service see person missing or not. Then find some things give obligatory service do at night. Most time just practice military song practice one hour or clean environment. Meet better duty squad leader assemble finish directly release us down rest.</li><li><em>19:00 ~ 20:00</em> <strong>Night Class</strong> - Same as above. Just practice military song and clean. More special have night march and night shooting. But only each once. But is very rare experience.</li><li><em>20:00 ~ 22:00</em> <strong>Free Time</strong> - Same just do whatever want. At this time not washed yet go wash. Otherwise rot in dormitory. Watch youtube, play phone, find girlfriend chat.</li><li><em>22:00</em> <strong>Bedtime</strong> - Bedtime turn off light. However want sleep or not is your business. Want play phone until dawn also fine. Sometimes also will ask outside eating sleeping voluntary service bring some good food from outside in this time eat.</li></ul><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p><a class=link href=https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%AD%E8%8F%AF%E6%B0%91%E5%9C%8B%E9%99%B8%E8%BB%8D%E8%A3%9D%E7%94%B2%E7%AC%AC%E4%BA%94%E5%85%AB%E5%9B%9B%E6%97%85 target=_blank rel=noopener>https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%AD%E8%8F%AF%E6%B0%91%E5%9C%8B%E9%99%B8%E8%BB%8D%E8%A3%9D%E7%94%B2%E7%AC%AC%E4%BA%94%E5%85%AB%E5%9B%9B%E6%97%85</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li></ol></div></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-tags><a href=/tags/military/>Military</a>
