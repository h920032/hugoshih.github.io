Different from the nervousness when I was a stage crew, a performer, or a core cadre watching Magic Night.
I was once again moved by this magical evening.
Recalling when I first stepped into the club class in my freshman year, watching Ding Hao perform circus tricks.
In a blink of an eye, I am about to put on the graduation scarf.
For four years, the Magic Club has been home, the center of life, and an inseparable part.
So let&rsquo;s summarize it with this reflection article.</p><h2 id=the-road-to-magic-night>The Road to Magic Night</h2><h3 id=origin>Origin</h3><p>The story began in high school when a senior from the Magic Club showed me a video of Hua Nei performing Le plus.
The video played, and he talked endlessly:
&ldquo;In the distant NTU Magic Club, there is a group of very powerful magicians, and no one knows why they are so powerful.&rdquo;
This made me very curious.
Later I learned that these people had been on the NTU Magic Night.
What kind of stage is that? Is it really as powerful as the rumors?</p><h3 id=19th-magic-night-the-league-of-performers>19th Magic Night &ldquo;The League of Performers&rdquo;</h3><p>The opportunity came quickly. In the winter vacation Magic is Concept event, I accidentally won two tickets for the 19th Magic Night.
Then I lobbied Yong Chen and friends from the club to go watch together.
In that environment where we could only watch Magic Talent Show to appreciate magic,
NTU Magic Night showed me a new world of magic.
Nine incredibly powerful performances and hosting that made people laugh from beginning to end.
This is really amazing. I must stand on this stage one day.</p><h3 id=20th-magic-night-lumos>20th Magic Night &ldquo;Lumos&rdquo;</h3><p>In the second semester of third year high school, even though I became a college entrance exam warrior, I still got a ticket for the 20th Magic Night.
Unfortunately, only half of the show was finished by 9:30, so I could only give up the idea of finishing Magic Night.
Later I heard about various wonderful things in the second half, and I really regretted it.
If I had known that the next time I could sit in the audience would be four years later, I would probably regret it even more QQ.</p><h3 id=21st-magic-night-21hero>21st Magic Night &ldquo;21Hero&rdquo;</h3><p>Then I muddle-headedly entered NTU.
Muddle-headedly joined the NTU Magic Club.
Muddle-headedly watched Yun Heng perform magic (Sorry Yun Heng QAQ, I often disappeared from club classes&mldr;)
Unknowingly, the time left for magic became less and less.
Until one day I really believed that my passion for magic was probably just this much.
Then Yong Chen suddenly told me he was asked to be a stage crew for Magic Night. He saw a lot of amazing things there.
Out of curiosity, I later also applied to be a stage crew and was lucky enough to be selected.
Stepping into the sacred place of the 2nd Activity Center, I saw many incredible things.
What shocked me first was Yang Yi&rsquo;s incredibly powerful performance.
Followed by each performer, under the meticulous carving of the elders day and night,
Evolving and transforming rapidly in a very short time, becoming amazingly cool performances.
It made me believe again that becoming a performer for NTU Magic Night is not an unattainable dream.</p><h3 id=22nd-magic-night-fantastical-beasts-and-where-to-find-them>22nd Magic Night &ldquo;Fantastical Beasts and Where to Find Them&rdquo;</h3><p>Driven by the Magic Night syndrome, I took the teaching exam and accepted the baptism of being a cadre for a whole year.
It can be considered as making up for the things I didn&rsquo;t learn well when I was a freshman.
Then hurriedly completed the selection process.
After passing the selection, I wasted the time before the first verification, and started various Magic Night journeys of rushing progress.
After the breakdown of the fifth verification, I finally completed a routine that I was reasonably satisfied with.
Finally stood on the stage of NTU Magic Night, fulfilling the promise I made to myself in high school.
There are too many people to thank along the way.
First of all, I must thank the hard-working core cadres.
Thank you for believing that I could go on Magic Night and giving me the opportunity.</p><ul><li><strong>Ming Han</strong>: Thank you for giving me many suggestions on aesthetics. Remember one day after the sixth verification when I was breaking down, you watched me finish the run and silently said: &ldquo;Nice run&rdquo;. At that moment, I really had the urge to burst into tears.</li><li><strong>Yun Heng</strong>: Thank you for giving me many suggestions on movements and lighting. Your strictness is definitely the driving force for our improvement.</li><li><strong>Zhang Teng</strong>: Thank you for helping me solve difficult problems with props, and thank you for often encouraging me and giving me spiritual support.</li><li><strong>Peng Ya</strong>: Thank you for often bringing a lot of food for us. Every time I see you coming, I feel redeemed.</li><li><strong>Xuan Bo</strong>: In the early stage of Magic Night when there was no direction, I almost used your performance as a template. Also thank you for tirelessly giving me many suggestions on costumes later. In the later stage of Magic Night, you also spent a lot of time helping me modify the routine. Without your help, I couldn&rsquo;t have produced this routine.</li><li><strong>Yan Yan</strong>: Thank you for always giving encouragement at various times. Even though schoolwork is busy, you still made time to help me modify the routine, making my routine more and more like what I had in mind.</li><li><strong>Xiao Mei</strong>: After you modified it, there was always a feeling of sudden evolution. I really like the things you modified. Also thank you for teaching me many concepts of movement design, which are still useful today.</li><li><strong>Bo Cheng</strong>: A senior who helped me a lot in high school. Thank you for helping me solve various difficult problems with sleight of hand during Magic Night.</li><li><strong>Hua Nei</strong>: Idol during high school. Although I heard you are very strict, I couldn&rsquo;t wait to ask you to help me modify the routine. Thank you for helping me pick out many flaws in movements, and also gave me many useful suggestions when deciding the direction in the early stage of the routine.</li><li><strong>Xiao Gui</strong>: Thank you for always being able to answer various questions in detail and comprehensively. The feedback given based on the video after each verification is also endlessly beneficial. Also thank you for solving some prop problems.</li><li><strong>En-Jui Shang</strong>: Idol number two during high school. Thank you for taking the time to help me modify the routine. You are as powerful as rumored, always able to elevate seemingly ordinary effects to another level.</li><li><strong>Zi Yuan</strong>: Thank you for often appearing in the 2nd Activity Center to watch me run the routine, and always being able to give a lot of suggestions after I finish running.</li><li><strong>Xiao Qiu</strong>: Thank you for always silently appearing in the 2nd Activity Center to watch us practice, and always tirelessly helping us solve various bugs in the routine.</li><li><strong>Ling Yu</strong>: Thank you for often coming to the 2nd Activity Center to give us encouragement.</li><li><strong>Yuan Ting</strong>: Thank you for giving me many suggestions in the early stage of the routine.</li><li><strong>Yang Yi</strong>: Thank you for giving me many out-of-the-box suggestions.</li><li><strong>Michael Yang</strong>: Thank you for giving me advice on props before the selection.</li><li><strong>Bai Cai</strong>: Thank you for taking the time to help me modify the routine.</li><li><strong>Jun Wei</strong>: Thank you for helping me when I couldn&rsquo;t make props.</li><li><strong>Jin Hao</strong>: Thank you for researching various circuits with me, although it wasn&rsquo;t used in the end QQ.</li><li><strong>Teacher Hsieh Kai Kai</strong>: Thank you for your energetic encouragement.</li><li><strong>Yu Ling</strong>: Thank you for often coming to the 2nd Activity Center to practice with us. When you are there, the 2nd Activity Center is always full of happy atmosphere.</li><li><strong>Yu Xian</strong>: Enthusiastically gave me many suggestions in the early stage of the routine.</li><li><strong>Everyone in the Teaching Group</strong>: Thank you for the various joys during each preview, which can always relieve the pressure during Magic Night.</li><li><strong>Yong Chen</strong>: It&rsquo;s really great to know you. From encouraging each other to go on stage in high school, to helping each other to go on Magic Night in college. I have to say you really gave me a lot of motivation to go on Magic Night. Look forward to us continuing to shine in various aspects in the future.</li><li><strong>How Jiun Hsu</strong>: Thank you for being so carry as the teaching head. I also admire your endless ideas in magic.</li><li><strong>Chang Jin</strong>: Always put forward many ideas during previews.</li><li><strong>Xuan Yu</strong>: Thank you for always being so serious and hard-working, arousing the passion for magic.</li><li><strong>Jie Li</strong>: Thank you for your various jokes, which can always make people smile knowingly.</li><li><strong>Everyone in 22nd Magic Night</strong>: Thank you You Zeng, Weng Jun, De Yan (Good luck with BIMF), Davin Dai, Yan Ni, You Ren, Meng Hao, Qing Chen, Hao Ping. Because of you, the 22nd Magic Night could be so wonderful.</li></ul><p>Thank you to the many elders of NTU for your help, so that I could stand on the stage. I keep all the elders who have helped me in my heart.
Only after experiencing Magic Night did I understand that fighting alone is not enough to support Magic Night.
Magic Night is the crystallization of the collective wisdom of the elders. Less one point and it would not be so perfect.</p><h3 id=23rd-magic-night-secret>23rd Magic Night &ldquo;Secret&rdquo;</h3><p>Magic Night syndrome struck again, and I took over as a core cadre.
Very grateful to the previous core cadres for believing that I was competent for this job.
Being a core cadre was where I learned the most things in the Magic Club.
Including various administrative affairs, crisis management.
How to organize an event well, how to plan a good evening party.
How to lead a group of performers, from knowing nothing to finally standing on the stage of NTU Magic Night.
And the process is still to thank the help of many NTU elders.</p><h4 id=thanks-to-core-cadre-partners>Thanks to Core Cadre Partners</h4><ul><li><strong>President Hao Jun</strong>: Thank you for always being so carry and reassuring. All unsolvable problems seem to naturally have answers in your hands.</li><li><strong>Vice President Xuan Yu</strong>: Your delicate mind can always directly and neatly give performers spiritual or substantial assistance. Also thank you for undertaking the position of stage director without hesitation.</li><li><strong>Executive Secretary Yan Ni</strong>: Thank you for sparing no effort in handling administrative affairs. Also thank you for always being able to give performers spiritual encouragement.</li></ul><h4 id=thanks-to-previous-core-cadres>Thanks to Previous Core Cadres</h4><ul><li><strong>Yun Heng</strong>: Even though your schoolwork is busy, you still devoted a lot of time to the Magic Club. From giving performers opinions and helping performers complete routines, to various administrative problems. Without you, the 23rd Magic Night would not have been so smooth.</li><li><strong>Zhang Teng</strong>: Still thank you for various prop support, as well as various assistance with lighting control on the day of Magic Night. Without you, Magic Night would not be so good-looking.</li><li><strong>Ming Han</strong>: Thank you for assisting in the production of promotional materials, and helping to make the super handsome opening video.</li><li><strong>Peng Ya</strong>: Thank you for various administrative support.</li></ul><h4 id=thanks-to-elders-who-often-come-back>Thanks to Elders Who Often Come Back</h4><ul><li><strong>Pang Zi</strong>: Thank you for trying your best for the performers of this session. And your fried seaweed.</li><li><strong>Bai Cai</strong>: Thank you for often coming back to help supervise performers&rsquo; practice.</li><li><strong>Xiao Qiu</strong>: Also thank you for often coming back to help supervise performers&rsquo; practice.</li><li><strong>Yong Chen</strong>: You are like the fifth core cadre, assisting us everywhere.</li><li><strong>Thank you to all elders</strong> who took time out of their busy schedules to come back and assist performers. Without you, there would be no 23rd Magic Night.</li><li><strong>Teacher Kai Sheng</strong>: You are the guardian deity of NTU Magic Night.</li></ul><h4 id=finally-congratulations-to-all-performers-of-the-23rd-magic-night>Finally, Congratulations to All Performers of the 23rd Magic Night</h4><p>Congratulations on achieving your goal and standing on the stage of NTU Magic Night. Thank you for your persistence.</p><ul><li><strong>Jian Hong</strong>: From a freshman who knew nothing, to a performer who can finally stand on stage alone. It is really gratifying to watch.</li><li><strong>Aaron</strong>: You are really a genius. You can always come up with many interesting interpretations yourself, and we don&rsquo;t need to worry too much.</li><li><strong>Jia Li</strong>: Thank you for your persistent efforts. The final performance is worthy of your efforts and the help of the elders.</li><li><strong>Jin Xuan</strong>: You are definitely the most serious performer in the 23rd Magic Night. From the summer vacation to the practice before the selection, you have never been lazy. And your smooth performance still impresses me. Also a performer that core cadres don&rsquo;t need to worry too much about.</li><li><strong>Zhong Han</strong>: Comedy role of 23rd Magic Night. Compared to cool magic, being funny probably suits you better. Your enthusiasm could be seen from the preparation for the selection. Very happy that you finally found the right way and exploded the whole audience.</li><li><strong>Yu Ling</strong>: Thank you for your love for the NTU Magic Club all along. Also congratulate you on finally completing a very wonderful performance that belongs to you.</li><li><strong>Lei Qiu</strong>: Thank you for your passion for magic all along. Also completed a quite powerful routine. Look forward to your development in the future.</li><li><strong>Qian Yu</strong>: Another genius. Your domineering air flows out naturally. Really amazing. Also thank you for holding up the finale position, and finally exploding the whole audience quite wonderfully.</li><li><strong>Hosts Yu Xiang, Jia Yi, Yan Yu, Sha Sha</strong>: Thank you for often staying up late to change the script, and racking your brains to come up with many very good jokes. You made me laugh from beginning to end on the day of Magic Night. It was really very good-looking.</li></ul><p>Whether being a core cadre is easy or not is a matter of opinion.
But the pressure is certainly not small.
After all, NTU Magic Night has always been known for its high standards, and now it is our turn to carry this pressure.
But when seeing the final result, all the efforts are worth it.</p><h3 id=24th-magic-night-magician-and-the-ideal-land>24th Magic Night &ldquo;Magician and the ideal land&rdquo;</h3><p>Unloaded the identity of a core cadre.
Have more time to try things I want to try.
Three years later, sitting in the audience again to appreciate NTU Magic Night.
Returned to the excited and expectant mood when first learning magic.
And the emotion after watching Magic Night lingered for a long time.
Sure enough, only NTU Magic Night can surpass NTU Magic Night.
NTU Magic Night is like a very long dream. After waking up from it,
You will know it is time to face your life properly.
Thank you to the core cadres of this session.
Thank you <strong>Fu Miao, Shi Fu, Aaron, Yan Yu</strong>. Thank you for doing your best to support the club.
Thank you to the performers of this session. Thank you for surviving various verifications and tests. Various hard work will turn into sweet fruits. Hope you all enjoyed this stage full of fantasy and charm.
Thank you to all elders, Teacher Kai Sheng.
We have completed such a good-looking evening party again.</p><h2 id=acknowledgements>Acknowledgements</h2><p>Important people should always be placed last.
<strong>Thank you parents</strong>
Thank you for allowing me to devote time to the Magic Club. Even though for the sake of the Magic Club, I haven&rsquo;t been home for dinner for a long time, haven&rsquo;t talked to you properly for a long time. You never stopped me. Also thank you for providing me with resources within your limited ability, giving me the ability to try and challenge. No matter what, you are the people I should thank the most.</p><p><strong>Thank you Jia Yi</strong>

Thank you for your unyielding soul.</p><p><strong>Finally, thank you NTU Magic Club</strong>
An initial curiosity, accidentally spent four years to explore.
Seemed like a blink of an eye, but it wasn&rsquo;t short either.
It&rsquo;s really a wonderful journey.</p><p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/cQu65bS.jpg loading=lazy alt="Image 1">
