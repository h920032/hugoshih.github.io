&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) is an operating system designed specifically for real-time applications, emphasizing &amp;ldquo;responding to events within a specific time limit (deadline)&amp;rdquo;. Imagine a scenario in the industrial field where a part of a machine suddenly malfunctions and needs to stop all motor operations in a very short time. If a traditional operating system like Linux is used, depending on the OS kernel scheduling policy, the action of stopping the motor may be slightly delayed. In contrast, an RTOS can have more flexible thread preemption, allowing emergency situations to be handled faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, the kernel usage of RTOS is similar. Basically, they can achieve multiple thread creation, round-robin execution, priority preemption, mutex locks, kernel-level interrupts, etc. More advanced ones have dynamic memory management and multi-core support. The main differences between these RTOS lie in the support for peripheral modules and the surrounding development ecosystem. The following introduces several currently mainstream common RTOS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="freertos"&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;FreeRTOS&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;FreeRTOS is maintained by Real Time Engineers Ltd. and Amazon. It is completely open source and widely used globally. FreeRTOS can be said to be the most common RTOS. Its success lies in being open source early, integrated by various IDEs early, and its shadow can be seen in the SDKs of various chips. I first contacted it in the Arduino IDE. FreeRTOS appeared in the Arduino library list very early. It is simple enough to use, without complex settings, and multi-threading can be implemented with a line or two of code, making it easy for beginners to enter the world of RTOS. Its backer is Amazon, and later it also integrated a lot of AWS IoT-related functions. Since it was open sourced early, there are many surrounding modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="azurertos-threadx"&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/eclipse-threadx/threadx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;AzureRTOS (Threadx)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;ThreadX is a real-time operating system (RTOS) developed by Express Logic. It was subsequently acquired by Microsoft and released as a renamed version AzureRTOS and open sourced. From the name, it can be seen that formerly it should be paired with Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Azure to do some IoT functions, but currently, no killer application seems to have been seen. Because it was open sourced relatively late, there are fewer surrounding packages, such as BLE and Wifi stacks, but I believe with native support from Microsoft, it should grow quickly. I encountered AzureRTOS because STM32 officially supports AzureRTOS natively. Interestingly, the STM32 development environment also supports FreeRTOS, but the support is far inferior to AzureRTOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="zephyr"&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Zephyr&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zephyr is an open-source real-time operating system (RTOS) led by the Linux Foundation. Although Zephyr has been around for a long time, it has only suddenly become popular in recent years. It features cross-platform compatibility and a complete development toolchain, with useful tools like West and architectures designed for cross-platform like DeviceTree. It can be said that to use Zephyr, you have to use this entire toolchain together to make it useful. However, it seems that due to the toolchain and compatibility reasons, although various chip manufacturers claim support, the support doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be that good, especially when it comes to very low-level hardware settings (like clock tree settings), it becomes particularly troublesome. if there is no such requirement, it is quite easy to use, and many settings and initializations are omitted for you. I encountered Zephyr because I used Nordic&amp;rsquo;s Bluetooth SoC. The latest nrf connect SDK is basically built on Zephyr, and Zephyr&amp;rsquo;s communication-related packages are also very complete, making it very suitable for Nordic chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rt-thread"&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/RT-Thread/rt-thread" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;RT-Thread&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;RT-Thread is an open-source real-time operating system (RTOS) led by a Chinese team. It is quite popular in China&amp;rsquo;s embedded system open source community and has good support for Chinese-made MCUs (especially some RISC-V chips), but it is rarely seen used elsewhere. Like Zephyr, there are many tools available. I haven&amp;rsquo;t used it myself yet, but what impressed me was that the RT-Thread community has a tool that can generate STM32 bootloader with one click. However, to use it, you need to register an account, and it is limited to registration with a Chinese phone number&amp;hellip;, which is not very friendly to developers outside of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2 id="thread"&gt;Thread
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Zephyr OS, each independent function or task can be placed in a different thread for execution. A lightweight scheduler is used internally to decide which thread can be executed by the CPU first, based on the priority of different threads and the state of the thread itself (ready, running, pending, etc.). Threads can have the following properties:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thread Priority: The smaller the value, the higher the priority (in the case of Preemptive scheduling).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stack Size: Each thread must configure its own stack space. Zephyr saves or restores the thread context when switching threads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thread Lifecycle: Can be pre-configured at compile time, or dynamically configured and created at run time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="two-common-methods-to-create-threads-in-zephyr"&gt;Two Common Methods to Create Threads in Zephyr
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id="create-thread-at-compile-time"&gt;Create Thread at Compile Time
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zephyr provides a macro &lt;code&gt;K_THREAD_DEFINE()&lt;/code&gt; to declare and create threads at compile time. As long as the program starts and initializes RTOS, these threads will be automatically created and managed by the scheduler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="k_thread_define"&gt;K_THREAD_DEFINE()
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;div class="chroma"&gt;
&lt;table class="lntable"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="lntd"&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="lntd"&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code class="language-c" data-lang="c"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#define K_THREAD_DEFINE(name, stack_size, entry_fn, p1, p2, p3, \
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt; prio, options, delay)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;name: Identifier name of this thread, which will also generate a variable of type k_tid_t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stack_size: Stack size of this thread (in bytes).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;entry_fn: Entry point function of this thread (thread function), which function to run when execution starts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;p1, p2, p3: Up to three parameters can be passed to the entry point function (all void* type).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;prio: Priority (smaller value means higher priority).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;options: Thread options, usually 0 implies no special settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;delay: Delay time before the thread starts (ticks or milliseconds). If 0, it means no delay and ready immediately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="create-thread-at-run-time"&gt;Create Thread at Run Time
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another way is to create threads during program execution, using the API function &lt;code&gt;k_thread_create()&lt;/code&gt;. This method is more flexible in some cases, for example, dynamically starting or terminating threads based on states or conditions, to avoid wasting resources by statically creating too many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="k_thread_create"&gt;k_thread_create()
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;div class="chroma"&gt;
&lt;table class="lntable"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="lntd"&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="lntd"&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code class="language-c" data-lang="c"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;k_tid_t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;k_thread_create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;k_thread&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;new_thread&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new_thread: Points to a struct k_thread object declared by the user, used to store the Thread Control Block (TCB) of this thread.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stack: Points to the stack space corresponding to this thread (needs to be statically or dynamically allocated with &lt;code&gt;K_THREAD_STACK_DEFINE()&lt;/code&gt; first).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stack_size: Size of this stack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;entry: Entry point function executed by the thread.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;p1, p2, p3: Up to three parameters to pass to the thread function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;prio: Priority.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;options: Thread options, commonly 0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;delay: Whether to delay before the thread starts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="example"&gt;Example
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following two code snippets demonstrate creating two threads using &lt;code&gt;K_THREAD_DEFINE()&lt;/code&gt; (at compile time) or &lt;code&gt;k_thread_create()&lt;/code&gt; (at run time) respectively, executing LED fading (fade_led) and LED blinking (toggle_led) functions.
&lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/h920032/Zephyr-blinky-toggle-demo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;github repo&lt;/a&gt;
The following is the execution result on Nucleo-F303K8, the left LED executes toggle, the right one executes fading.

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="example-of-dynamic-thread-creation-at-compile-time"&gt;Example of Dynamic Thread Creation at Compile Time
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;K_THREAD_DEFINE(fade_tid, 512, fade_led, NULL, NULL, NULL, 5, 0, 0);&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a thread named fade_tid, stack size 512 bytes, executing function fade_led, priority 5.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;p1, p2, p3 are all NULL, indicating no parameters need to be passed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;K_THREAD_DEFINE(toggle_tid, 512, toggle_led, NULL, NULL, NULL, 5, 0, 0);&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a thread named toggle_tid similarly, stack size and priority parameters consistent with above, executing function toggle_led.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These threads are already &amp;ldquo;statically allocated&amp;rdquo; during compilation, so when the system starts and executes to main(), they will be automatically started and continuously executed by the scheduler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id="example-of-dynamic-thread-creation-at-run-time"&gt;Example of Dynamic Thread Creation at Run Time
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to create threads during program execution (e.g., triggered by an event), you can use the following method:
1. Use &lt;code&gt;K_THREAD_STACK_DEFINE(my_stack_area, STACK_SIZE)&lt;/code&gt;; to define stack.
2. Define a struct k_thread my_thread_data; as Thread Control Block (TCB).
3. Call k_thread_create(), passing the above stack, control block, entry point function and other parameters to complete creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is an example showing how to dynamically create threads in the main() function (this example only shows parts related to threads, omitting repetitive code like peripheral initialization):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id="comparison"&gt;Comparison
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Creation Method&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Features&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Typical Use Cases&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Compile Time Creation&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;K_THREAD_DEFINE()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;When required threads are known from the start, and system resources are sufficient&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Run Time Dynamic Creation&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;k_thread_create()&lt;/code&gt;, allocate resources during program execution&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;When unsure how many threads are needed, or need flexible creation/release&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it is certain that the number of threads is fixed throughout the system lifecycle, or the system is relatively simple (such as a simple multi-tasking control), using compile-time method can reduce code complexity and allow the program to be ready quickly upon startup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If tasks are dynamically generated/cancelled in the system (e.g., detecting a new device starts a new task), you can use the dynamic creation method to improve system flexibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Static (Compile Time) Thread Creation:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;K_THREAD_DEFINE()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple, fast, clear program architecture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suitable for fixed and few long-term threads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dynamic (Run Time) Thread Creation:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;k_thread_create()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Need to manage stack, control block etc. yourself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suitable for application scenarios requiring flexible creation and destruction of large or indefinite number of threads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
