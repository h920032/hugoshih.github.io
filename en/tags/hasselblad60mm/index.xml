&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2 id="preface"&gt;Preface
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the camera consumer market, the king in lens field besides &lt;strong&gt;Leica&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Carl Zeiss&lt;/strong&gt; lenses are also equally outstanding. Zeiss, known as optics giant, through powerful optical design strength developed various classic optical structures dominating until today in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first Zeiss lens was &lt;strong&gt;Distagon ZF 35mm f2&lt;/strong&gt; designed for &lt;strong&gt;Nikon F&lt;/strong&gt; mount. Classic retrofocus structure has excellent distortion control. Classic Zeiss T* coating controls contrast and sharpness just right. Just pity huge lens body really hard to accept. Sold this lens after using for a while. Nevertheless, I still looked forward to day returning to Zeiss embrace. So I later was easily pushed into pit of &lt;strong&gt;Hasselblad&lt;/strong&gt;. About how I was pushed into Hasselblad pit can refer to this: &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.hugoshih.com/p/mechanical-camera-series-hasselblad-a12-magazine-loading-method/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Hasselblad A12 Magazine Loading Method&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Hasselblad, have to mention series of medium format classic lenses Carl Zeiss designed and manufactured for it. Directly let Hasselblad cameras rank among cameras of optical peak. Became artifact for landscape and commercial photography. Even later brought to moon together with lenses. From this can see power of Zeiss lenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In world of Hasselblad most common is that classic 80mm f2.8 standard lens. Equivalent to about 50mm on medium format. Having larger aperture and familiar and easy to master focal length. Became Hasselblad&amp;rsquo;s most popular entry lens. However I didn&amp;rsquo;t choose this lens. Main reason lies in premium of this lens in market too high. Also focal length too common. I want picture relatively different from others. Just under some coincidence I accidentally bumped into this &lt;strong&gt;CB 60mm f3.4&lt;/strong&gt;. Equivalent 35mm small wide angle meets my needs for street photography. Also this is known as one of sharper lenses in Hasselblad system. Under comprehensive consideration chose this lens as my &lt;strong&gt;Hasselblad 500C/M&lt;/strong&gt; hanging lens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Hasselblad camera and lens&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zeiss worthy of optics giant. Having classic optical designs to overcome various engineering problems. And &lt;strong&gt;Distagon&lt;/strong&gt; optical structure in Zeiss lens history is as impressive as &lt;strong&gt;Biogon&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Planar&lt;/strong&gt;. Distagon is Zeiss&amp;rsquo;s retrofocus structure. Since SLR cameras like &lt;strong&gt;Nikon FM2&lt;/strong&gt; and Hasselblad must have a mirror behind lens to reflect lens image to viewfinder. &lt;strong&gt;Flange distance&lt;/strong&gt; meaning distance between camera lens mount and focal plane. Will be much longer than rangefinder cameras like Leica. This influence not big for telephoto lenses. Because telephoto lens own design can make last element of lens far from focal plane. However for wide angle lens this is much difficult. Like Schneider classic &lt;strong&gt;Angulon&lt;/strong&gt; design on Leica last element of lens almost sticking to Leica camera shutter curtain. If use this lens on SLR camera definitely will be hit by flipping mirror. Therefore a structure able to move out back focal distance and able to achieve wide angle effect must be invented. Therefore appeared Distagon this kind retrofocus structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="https://i.imgur.com/fXpwuKr.jpg" width="30%" alt="Image description" &gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leica&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Super-Angulon 21mm f/4&lt;/strong&gt; lens&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retrofocus structure as name suggests is opposite relative to telephoto structure. Design is based on inverted telescope optical path. Traditional telescope usually uses a set of convex lenses to collect and concentrate light at a point. Then use a set of concave lenses to spread these lights. To magnify image observer sees. However, retrofocus lens design adopts opposite concept. Use a concave mirror at front of lens to collect as wide light as possible. Then concentrate light then expand with convex lens at lens tail. This design allows lens better correct aberration. And able to make incident light closer perpendicular to sensor plane. Thereby providing clearer, more precise image. &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="https://photographylife.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Leica-APO-Telyt-M-135mm-f3.4-ASPH-Diagram.jpg" width="45%" alt="Image description" &gt;
&lt;img src="https://i1.wp.com/pic3.zhimg.com/50/6ec4332bd79560f6ba5ca9e38279b496_hd.png" width="45%" alt="Image description" &gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Left is Leica 135mm APO telephoto structure, right is Zeiss Distagon retrofocus structure &lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However disadvantage of retrofocus structure also obvious. Due to need use large amount of lenses to correct. Makes this kind of lens volume relatively large. Comparable to size of telephoto lens. In addition more lenses also bring more aberrations. Wide angle distortion effect retrofocus lens can achieve still not as good as those wide angle lenses designed sticking to focal plane. Therefore later Hasselblad specially designed specialized body for Zeiss Biogon lens which is &lt;strong&gt;Hasselblad 903 SWC&lt;/strong&gt;. From this can see such design still has status Distagon cannot replace. Furthermore like Zeiss Hologon lens with extremely high legendary color. Only used four elements achieved nearly perfect 15mm wide angle structure is genius design. Pity cannot use on SLR camera. And not as practical as Distagon. All in all Distagon structure provides SLR enthusiasts opportunity to explore wide angle world. As long as you don&amp;rsquo;t fear that big and heavy lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="https://lens-db.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/5d773dba6cf6c-1160x1160.jpg" width="40%" alt="Image description" &gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hasselblad 903 SWC&lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to this &lt;strong&gt;Hasselblad CB 60mm f3.5&lt;/strong&gt; lens I own. Like most Distagon lenses. This is not a very light lens. Compared to Planar structure 80mm f2.8. Length longer bit. Weight also heavier bit. 60mm focal length equivalent conversion to 135 format about 35mm lens picture. Is an out-and-out small wide angle. Know played Leica know Leica players love 35mm lens. Like Seven Elements, Eight Elements existence like best quality in Leica world. Part comes from 35mm small wide angle characteristic can approach character and record character and surrounding scenery together. Has quite good realistic utility. This kind of lens also naturally positioned as humanity lens. And after actual use this 60mm lens for Hasselblad also indeed feel used to shoot humanity will be better than shooting landscape. And this slightly different from using Hasselblad for landscape photography most people think in heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;60mm this focal length not only appears in CB series. From earliest C series lenses to later CF, CFi series can see figure of 60mm f3.5. Except appearance change generation by generation. Optical design inside consistent. And 60mm f3.5 and 100mm f3.5 praised as two sharpest lenses in Hasselblad. Although CB series lens always considered cheap substitute of CF series. Also indeed in shutter function lacks F shutter used for Hasselblad 200F series. But on Hasselblad 500 series usage experience of this lens completely same as CF series. Even optical coating might be more advanced than CF series. Therefore this is still a very great choice under insufficient budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sample-shots"&gt;Sample Shots
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Said so much lets see actual shooting appearance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First come a Freedom Square gate shot using &lt;strong&gt;Fujifilm Pro400h&lt;/strong&gt;. Can see still very slight wide angle distortion. And Zeiss optical aesthetic consistent high sharpness and high contrast. Can note rear National Concert Hall red pillars highlighted.

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look performance using &lt;strong&gt;Fujifilm Provia100f&lt;/strong&gt; positive film again:

&gt;
Scene in traditional market. Brightness of vegetables fruits and characters of sign highlight feature of Zeiss lens. Especially colors of vegetables fruits restored very well. Have to say this lens very suitable for shooting such scene. Medium format own spatial sense plus 60mm small wide angle makes people feel immersed in it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Hasselblad of course still want be a landscape photographer. Look Pescadores scenery shot with &lt;strong&gt;Fujifilm Pro400h&lt;/strong&gt; below

Building on a certain beach on Qimei Island. 60mm lens can blend foreground and background together very well
&lt;img src="https://i.imgur.com/A71OaIA.jpg"

&gt;
Interesting orange stone pier and blue green sea set off each other. When 60mm lens place horizon in center foreground ground proportion larger

&gt;
This more like lens test. Can see slight distortion at edge

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally come two B&amp;amp;W photos under low light. Shot with &lt;strong&gt;ILFORD FP4&lt;/strong&gt;

&gt;
Make me more determined this is humanity lens no doubt&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choosing a lens needs consider its application scene. This is also why I love and hate this &lt;strong&gt;CB 60mm f3.5&lt;/strong&gt;. Love it because 35mm is my beloved focal length. I very like humanity, street theme photography. Pity it is a Hasselblad lens. Hasselblad&amp;rsquo;s big and clumsy body destined it is a very time-consuming operation camera. Suitable for slow rhythm photography. And for rapid change of street. I feel Hasselblad hard to adapt. Hasselblad destined to be camera born for landscape, for commercial photography. In such scene small wide angle lens appears not up not down. Not shocking as those ultra wide angle lens picture. Also not able focus on scenery in small range as telephoto lens. Or maybe for me Hasselblad with telephoto lens will be choice more suitable for me. So transferred this lens end of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Record this lens once owned with this article.&lt;/p&gt;
