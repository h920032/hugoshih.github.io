[{"content":"Origin I suffered a big loss on this thing. As for what the loss was, I won\u0026rsquo;t go into details. In short, when I first saw this thing, I didn\u0026rsquo;t understand it thoroughly, so I\u0026rsquo;m taking this opportunity to pay off my debt. I want to use a super plain way to make people understand quickly, so next time I encounter this issue, I can quickly recall it.\nWhat is Aligned Memory Allocation? Imagine a situation where the program runs to a point where I need some extra memory to store new data. In C language, we will definitely use malloc() to ask the system for extra memory space.\nFor example, I suddenly need 32 bytes of space, so I use malloc(), and then the system looks around and finally finds 32 bytes of space in the memory and returns the starting memory address. This starting position might be very random, like 0x08004321, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter. Anyway, I now have 32 bytes of space, and I can do whatever I want with it.\nHowever, in some cases (I\u0026rsquo;ll talk about which cases later), we would hope that the starting position of the memory we get is \u0026ldquo;aligned\u0026rdquo;. So what is alignment?\nFor example, if you use some Hex file preview tools, you will see that the starting position on the left is neatly arranged at 32 bytes intervals, like this:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 General Random Allocation (Unaligned): 0x08004321 | Data... ^ Starting position is random 32-byte Alignment (Aligned): 0x08000000 | Data... 0x08000020 | Data... \u0026lt;-- 0x20 is 32 0x08000040 | Data... \u0026lt;-- 0x40 is 64 ^ Starting positions are all divisible by 32 So-called Aligned Memory Allocation means that when I ask for new memory space, I want to get a memory space whose starting position can be divisible by 32 (or other numbers).\nOK, so up to this point, you should have some concept of what Aligned Memory Allocation is. That\u0026rsquo;s half the battle. Because most people hearing about this for the first time probably find it hard to imagine what it is, or know what it is but don\u0026rsquo;t know what it\u0026rsquo;s used for.\nSo, what is the use of this?\nWhy is Alignment Needed? The need for Alignment is mostly due to hardware design constraints, for example:\nVector instruction sets (such as AVX), when executing such instruction sets, will require the target memory position to be aligned. If it is not aligned, it has to be split into two steps to handle, or an error will occur directly. Why not design the instruction set to read memory starting from any position? I think it\u0026rsquo;s mostly a cost consideration. If it can be solved on the driver side, why waste expensive hardware space?\nOthers like CUDA, when fetching data via PCIe on GPU, using DMA will also require memory to be aligned. Or when GPU instructions fetch data from its own memory, it will also require alignment. In addition, when using DMA on single chips like STM32, the memory position of the buffer will also be required to be aligned so that it can be correctly written or read by DMA.\nAt this time, someone will definitely jump out and say: \u0026ldquo;I usually use CUDA or use DMA on STM32 and haven\u0026rsquo;t encountered this problem!\u0026rdquo;\nThat\u0026rsquo;s because the CUDA driver or HAL library etc. will handle it for you, so of course you don\u0026rsquo;t feel it. Conversely, if you are writing a driver or doing bare metal development today, you must be careful about memory alignment, otherwise it might not even move.\nSo how to achieve Alignment? Having said so much, how can we achieve Alignment during memory allocation?\nImagine that our goal today is to get a new 64 bytes memory, and require 32-byte alignment. If the starting position given by malloc today happens to be 0x08000040, which is the starting position of an alignment block, then we hit the jackpot, but in reality, we are certainly not that lucky. The starting position it gives you might be 0x08000041 (offset by 1 byte), or it might be 0x0800005F (offset by 31 bytes).\nBut it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter. At this time, we will think that as long as the memory malloc\u0026rsquo;d is long enough, finding the starting point of an Alignment Block from it and starting to store data from there, that also counts as alignment.\nSo the question returns to, how long memory should we ask for? Observing the previous example, if doing 32 bytes alignment, the offset amount is at most 0 ~ 31 bytes. So the space we want to malloc() must be at least size + alignment - 1.\nWait, something seems missing? If so, how can we free those spaces before the alignment starting address? We need to record the starting address originally malloc\u0026rsquo;d, so we need one more position to store this pointer. This required space is sizeof(void*).\nIn summary, the length we really want to malloc() is: size + alignment - 1 + sizeof(void*)\nMemory Structure Diagram:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 Actual malloc\u0026#39;d block (Original) | v +-------------+---------------------+-------------------------+ | padding ... | Original Pointer | User Pointer (Aligned) | | | (Stored) | | +-------------+---------------------+-------------------------+ ^ ^ | | This slot stores Fits 32-byte alignment original address We return this address Then we just need to find the alignment starting address inside, and store the \u0026ldquo;original starting address\u0026rdquo; in the slot before the alignment start. This way, when freeing memory, just look one slot backward from the alignment address, and we can find the memory starting point we should free.\nThe principle concept is just like this. So let\u0026rsquo;s see how to implement it.\nC Implementation The following takes 32-byte alignment as an example. You can change 32 to any positive integer alignment you want (usually a power of 2).\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 #include \u0026lt;stdlib.h\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;stdint.h\u0026gt; // for uintptr_t void* aligned_malloc(size_t size) { // 1. Calculate the total space needed: // size + adjustment space of (alignment - 1) + space to store original pointer void *original = malloc(size + 32 - 1 + sizeof(void*)); if (!original) return NULL; // 2. Calculate the alignment starting position // First reserve a pointer space for us to store the address uintptr_t raw = (uintptr_t)original + sizeof(void*); // Use Bitwise operation for alignment // Principle: (address + mask) \u0026amp; ~mask // Note: Here use ~(32 - 1) i.e. ~31 to mask off the last five bits to achieve 32 alignment uintptr_t aligned = (raw + (32 - 1)) \u0026amp; ~(32 - 1); // Actually can also use (void*)(original - (original % 32)); to calculate // Just that using bit manipulation feels more elegant // 3. Store the original malloc() starting address in the slot before the alignment address ((void**)aligned)[-1] = original; // 4. Finally return the alignment start return (void*)aligned; } void aligned_free(void *ptr) { if (!ptr) return; // When freeing, find the original malloc address stored one slot before the alignment address void *original = ((void**)ptr)[-1]; // Then just free it free(original); } Conclusion Anyway, that\u0026rsquo;s it. Aligned Memory Allocation is important and has some implementation details. Taking this opportunity, I have figured it out. Even if I forget it in the future, I can quickly come back to review it.\nReference How to implement an aligned_alloc () ?

Imagine a scenario in the industrial field where a part of a machine suddenly malfunctions and needs to stop all motor operations in a very short time. If a traditional operating system like Linux is used, depending on the OS kernel scheduling policy, the action of stopping the motor may be slightly delayed. In contrast, an RTOS can have more flexible thread preemption, allowing emergency situations to be handled faster.\nEssentially, the kernel usage of RTOS is similar. Basically, they can achieve multiple thread creation, round-robin execution, priority preemption, mutex locks, kernel-level interrupts, etc. More advanced ones have dynamic memory management and multi-core support. The main differences between these RTOS lie in the support for peripheral modules and the surrounding development ecosystem. The following introduces several currently mainstream common RTOS:\nFreeRTOS FreeRTOS is maintained by Real Time Engineers Ltd. and Amazon. It is completely open source and widely used globally. FreeRTOS can be said to be the most common RTOS. Its success lies in being open source early, integrated by various IDEs early, and its shadow can be seen in the SDKs of various chips. I first contacted it in the Arduino IDE. FreeRTOS appeared in the Arduino library list very early. It is simple enough to use, without complex settings, and multi-threading can be implemented with a line or two of code, making it easy for beginners to enter the world of RTOS. Its backer is Amazon, and later it also integrated a lot of AWS IoT-related functions. Since it was open sourced early, there are many surrounding modules.\nAzureRTOS (Threadx) ThreadX is a real-time operating system (RTOS) developed by Express Logic. It was subsequently acquired by Microsoft and released as a renamed version AzureRTOS and open sourced. From the name, it can be seen that formerly it should be paired with Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s Azure to do some IoT functions, but currently, no killer application seems to have been seen. Because it was open sourced relatively late, there are fewer surrounding packages, such as BLE and Wifi stacks, but I believe with native support from Microsoft, it should grow quickly. I encountered AzureRTOS because STM32 officially supports AzureRTOS natively. Interestingly, the STM32 development environment also supports FreeRTOS, but the support is far inferior to AzureRTOS.\nZephyr Zephyr is an open-source real-time operating system (RTOS) led by the Linux Foundation. Although Zephyr has been around for a long time, it has only suddenly become popular in recent years. It features cross-platform compatibility and a complete development toolchain, with useful tools like West and architectures designed for cross-platform like DeviceTree. It can be said that to use Zephyr, you have to use this entire toolchain together to make it useful. However, it seems that due to the toolchain and compatibility reasons, although various chip manufacturers claim support, the support doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be that good, especially when it comes to very low-level hardware settings (like clock tree settings), it becomes particularly troublesome. if there is no such requirement, it is quite easy to use, and many settings and initializations are omitted for you. I encountered Zephyr because I used Nordic\u0026rsquo;s Bluetooth SoC. The latest nrf connect SDK is basically built on Zephyr, and Zephyr\u0026rsquo;s communication-related packages are also very complete, making it very suitable for Nordic chips.\nRT-Thread RT-Thread is an open-source real-time operating system (RTOS) led by a Chinese team. It is quite popular in China\u0026rsquo;s embedded system open source community and has good support for Chinese-made MCUs (especially some RISC-V chips), but it is rarely seen used elsewhere. Like Zephyr, there are many tools available.

A lightweight scheduler is used internally to decide which thread can be executed by the CPU first, based on the priority of different threads and the state of the thread itself (ready, running, pending, etc.). Threads can have the following properties:\nThread Priority: The smaller the value, the higher the priority (in the case of Preemptive scheduling). Stack Size: Each thread must configure its own stack space. Zephyr saves or restores the thread context when switching threads. Thread Lifecycle: Can be pre-configured at compile time, or dynamically configured and created at run time. Two Common Methods to Create Threads in Zephyr Create Thread at Compile Time Zephyr provides a macro K_THREAD_DEFINE() to declare and create threads at compile time. As long as the program starts and initializes RTOS, these threads will be automatically created and managed by the scheduler.\nK_THREAD_DEFINE() 1 2 #define K_THREAD_DEFINE(name, stack_size, entry_fn, p1, p2, p3, \\ prio, options, delay) name: Identifier name of this thread, which will also generate a variable of type k_tid_t. stack_size: Stack size of this thread (in bytes). entry_fn: Entry point function of this thread (thread function), which function to run when execution starts. p1, p2, p3: Up to three parameters can be passed to the entry point function (all void* type). prio: Priority (smaller value means higher priority). options: Thread options, usually 0 implies no special settings. delay: Delay time before the thread starts (ticks or milliseconds). If 0, it means no delay and ready immediately. Create Thread at Run Time Another way is to create threads during program execution, using the API function k_thread_create(). This method is more flexible in some cases, for example, dynamically starting or terminating threads based on states or conditions, to avoid wasting resources by statically creating too many.\nk_thread_create() 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 k_tid_t k_thread_create( struct k_thread *new_thread, k_thread_stack_t *stack, size_t stack_size, k_thread_entry_t entry, void *p1, void *p2, void *p3, int prio, uint32_t options, k_timeout_t delay ); new_thread: Points to a struct k_thread object declared by the user, used to store the Thread Control Block (TCB) of this thread. stack: Points to the stack space corresponding to this thread (needs to be statically or dynamically allocated with K_THREAD_STACK_DEFINE() first). stack_size: Size of this stack. entry: Entry point function executed by the thread. p1, p2, p3: Up to three parameters to pass to the thread function. prio: Priority. options: Thread options, commonly 0. delay: Whether to delay before the thread starts. Example The following two code snippets demonstrate creating two threads using K_THREAD_DEFINE() (at compile time) or k_thread_create() (at run time) respectively, executing LED fading (fade_led) and LED blinking (toggle_led) functions. github repo The following is the execution result on Nucleo-F303K8, the left LED executes toggle, the right one executes fading. Example of Dynamic Thread Creation at Compile Time K_THREAD_DEFINE(fade_tid, 512, fade_led, NULL, NULL, NULL, 5, 0, 0); Create a thread named fade_tid, stack size 512 bytes, executing function fade_led, priority 5. p1, p2, p3 are all NULL, indicating no parameters need to be passed. K_THREAD_DEFINE(toggle_tid, 512, toggle_led, NULL, NULL, NULL, 5, 0, 0); Create a thread named toggle_tid similarly, stack size and priority parameters consistent with above, executing function toggle_led. These threads are already \u0026ldquo;statically allocated\u0026rdquo; during compilation, so when the system starts and executes to main(), they will be automatically started and continuously executed by the scheduler.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 #include \u0026lt;stdio.h\u0026gt;

} // Configure GPIO pin as output gpio_pin_configure_dt(\u0026amp;led1, GPIO_OUTPUT_ACTIVE); // After main function ends, the two threads created by K_THREAD_DEFINE will continue to execute return 0; } Example of Dynamic Thread Creation at Run Time If you want to create threads during program execution (e.g., triggered by an event), you can use the following method: 1.\tUse K_THREAD_STACK_DEFINE(my_stack_area, STACK_SIZE); to define stack. 2.\tDefine a struct k_thread my_thread_data; as Thread Control Block (TCB). 3.\tCall k_thread_create(), passing the above stack, control block, entry point function and other parameters to complete creation.\nThe following is an example showing how to dynamically create threads in the main() function (this example only shows parts related to threads, omitting repetitive code like peripheral initialization):\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 /* Previous code is same */ // Declare thread stack size static K_THREAD_STACK_DEFINE(fade_stack, 512); static K_THREAD_STACK_DEFINE(toggle_stack, 512); // Declare thread control block static struct k_thread fade_thread_data; static struct k_thread toggle_thread_data; // These two functions are similar to previous example void fade_led(void *p1, void *p2, void *p3) { // ... } void toggle_led(void *p1, void *p2, void *p3) { // ... } int main(void) { // Dynamically create fade_led thread at run time k_tid_t fade_tid = k_thread_create( \u0026amp;fade_thread_data, my_fade_stack, K_THREAD_STACK_SIZEOF(my_fade_stack), fade_led, NULL, NULL, NULL, 5, 0, K_NO_WAIT ); // Dynamically create toggle_led thread at run time k_tid_t toggle_tid = k_thread_create( \u0026amp;toggle_thread_data, my_toggle_stack, K_THREAD_STACK_SIZEOF(my_toggle_stack), toggle_led, NULL, NULL, NULL, 5, 0, K_NO_WAIT ); // k_thread_create returns k_tid_t, which can be used for subsequent thread management // e.g. k_thread_suspend(fade_tid), k_thread_resume(fade_tid), k_thread_abort(fade_tid)... return 0; } Comparison Creation Method Features Typical Use Cases Compile Time Creation K_THREAD_DEFINE() When required threads are known from the start, and system resources are sufficient Run Time Dynamic Creation k_thread_create(), allocate resources during program execution When unsure how many threads are needed, or need flexible creation/release If it is certain that the number of threads is fixed throughout the system lifecycle, or the system is relatively simple (such as a simple multi-tasking control), using compile-time method can reduce code complexity and allow the program to be ready quickly upon startup. If tasks are dynamically generated/cancelled in the system (e.g., detecting a new device starts a new task), you can use the dynamic creation method to improve system flexibility. Summary Static (Compile Time) Thread Creation: Use K_THREAD_DEFINE() Simple, fast, clear program architecture Suitable for fixed and few long-term threads Dynamic (Run Time) Thread Creation: Use k_thread_create() Need to manage stack, control block etc. yourself Suitable for application scenarios requiring flexible creation and destruction of large or indefinite number of threads ","date":"2025-01-05T22:20:31+08:00","image":"https://i.imgur.com/V5OSNcL.jpg","permalink":"https://www.hugoshih.com/p/two-ways-to-create-threads-in-zephyr-rtos/","title":"Two Ways to Create Threads in Zephyr RTOS"},{"content":"Common MCUs in Embedded Systems Recently, while implementing an embedded system, I needed more powerful computing capabilities, so I decided to move away from the commonly used Atmega328p and look for other 32-bit MCU development platforms. Choosing a platform is a big decision, as each platform has different use cases and development environments. I\u0026rsquo;ll take this opportunity to analyze them.\nATMEL Series (e.g., ATMEGA328P) Atmega328p is an 8-bit AVR architecture MCU produced by ATMEL (USA), commonly found on Arduino UNO boards. Pros: Easy to get started, complete documentation, complete community support (excellent Arduino ecosystem), good power efficiency (haven\u0026rsquo;t tested this personally but heard it\u0026rsquo;s good). Cons: Limited processing power compared to other 32-bit MCUs, less internal memory and RAM, slightly expensive for its performance (around 35 NTD). Use Cases: Beginner projects (e.g., Arduino tutorials, simple embedded projects), low-power and low-cost home electronic devices. ESP Series (e.g., ESP32-C3) ESP32-C3 is a product of Espressif Systems (China), based on 32-bit RISC-V or Xtensa architecture, with built-in WiFi and Bluetooth capabilities. Pros: Includes WiFi and Bluetooth without external modules, so high CP value (one chip 35-50 NTD), widely used with decent community support, versions with internal SPI flash are very convenient. Cons: Higher power consumption (although it has deep sleep capability), system stability is rumored to be less than ideal. Use Cases: IoT (Internet of Things) devices requiring WiFi or Bluetooth connection, smart home appliances, smart wearable devices, non-critical applications. STM Series (e.g., STM32F103C8T6) STM32F103C8T6 is a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M3 microcontroller from STMicroelectronics (Switzerland). Pros: Strong computing power, multiple interfaces, low-power versions available, high cost-performance ratio (wide range from 20-60 NTD), complete development and debugging tools, commonly used in industrial products. Cons: Development environment is more complex, less RAM and Flash in some models. Use Cases: Complex embedded projects, applications requiring strong processing power, industrial automation, drones, high-end sensor systems. STC Series (e.g., STC89C52) STC89C52 is an 8-bit 8051 microcontroller produced by STC Micro (China). Pros: 8051 architecture is very old, has extensive applications and massive data support, ultra-cheap (10-50 NTD), development environment is relatively simple. Cons: Very old architecture, limited processing power, less memory and RAM, can be seen as a weakened version of Atmel series, but because functions are simple, it\u0026rsquo;s commonly used in home appliances. Use Cases: Traditional embedded systems, such as home appliance control, educational purposes, learning 8051 microcontroller principles and programming, simple LED display, keyboard input, and other basic IO operations. RASPBERRY Series (e.g., RP2040) RP2040 is a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M0+ microcontroller developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation (UK). Pros: Efficient processing performance, relatively large RAM, open-source resources and community support, simple development environment (Micropython), high CP value (35 NTD). Cons: Newer product, may have hardware instability issues or bugs without solutions yet. Use Cases: Embedded projects requiring high-performance processing, audio/video computing, image processing, complex algorithm computing, big data processing, running TinyML models, etc. ","date":"2023-08-21T19:32:31+08:00","image":"https://i.imgur.com/xEqWwbo.jpg","permalink":"https://www.hugoshih.com/p/common-mcus-in-embedded-systems/","title":"Common MCUs in Embedded Systems"},{"content":"Google Technical Program Manager Interview Experience Preface There have always been many Google SWE interview experiences shared, however, Technical Program Manager (TPM) interview experiences are almost non-existent. In fact, not only on Dcard but also on major foreign websites, there are very few TPM interview experience shares. Therefore, I am sharing this. Although I did not get the offer, I interviewed until the end, and the experience should be referable.\nMy past education and experience include a Bachelor\u0026rsquo;s and Master\u0026rsquo;s in EE/CS from NTU. After finishing military service this year, I worked as a TPM in a company slightly larger than Google. I had always wanted to enter Google. Last year, I also applied for a Google SWE interview. After finishing the interview and passing HC, waiting for Team match, I encountered a Hiring Freeze. For detailed experience, please refer to: Google SWE Interview Journey. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t until the economy improved this year that I started Fit talk again. However, I matched with three teams and didn\u0026rsquo;t get any. Just as I was disheartened, I received a TPM interview invitation from another HR. With the mentality of gathering intelligence, I scheduled a 1:1 with HR. Actually, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t very interested in the Google TPM vacancy initially, but after being persuaded by HR in the meeting, I accepted the interview invitation with a \u0026ldquo;why not try it\u0026rdquo; attitude.\nTimeline 5/12 - Received TPM interview invitation from HR 5/23 - 1:1 with HR to understand the vacancy 6/13 - VO: Technical Judgement * 2 6/20 - VO: PgM + GCA 6/30 - 1:1 with HR to notify interview result: not move forward Interview The Google TPM VO interview has a total of five rounds, each 45 minutes:\nTwo rounds of Technical Judgement interview One round of Program Management related (PgM) interview One round of General Cognitive Ability (GCA) interview One round of Googleyness interview Maybe because I had interviewed for Googleyness before, this round was skipped directly. In fact, I only interviewed for four rounds. Considering my technical ability might be slightly better than my PM ability, HR first scheduled two Technical Judgement interviews for me. If the results were good, then PgM and GCA would be scheduled. Later it proved to be the correct strategy.\nAccording to online intelligence and documents provided by HR, I thought the Technical Judgement interview might be like a technical interview, possibly asking for Coding, or maybe System design. For this, I even dug out leetcode and brushed up a few questions to warm up; PgM might ask experience-related questions; GCA might ask about problem-solving logic, but at that time I couldn\u0026rsquo;t think of any preparation direction, so I only finished reading the reference materials given by HR, and recalled a few more small stories. Since I really couldn\u0026rsquo;t think of how to prepare, I also tried to ask HR for some Hints, but HR seemed to have given me everything they could give, so I just bit the bullet. Learning, right\u0026hellip;\nBy the way, the TPM interview is entirely in English. I spoke English non-stop for about two hours in four rounds. This requirement is understandable. In a company like Google, Cross-function communication relies heavily on English. This point is also very different from the SWE interview. SWE only has two rounds of English, and you don\u0026rsquo;t talk all the time.\nTechnical Judgement To be honest, I started doubting life when I heard the first question. I was already in the posture to write Code, but the first question was: \u0026ldquo;What is your most successful project?\u0026rdquo; (I can\u0026rsquo;t remember the detailed question, anyway, it was similar to this). It was the kind of question I thought would be asked in PgM or GCA interviews. Fortunately, I had prepared quite a few small stories before. I changed my posture and brought out projects with some technical depth from university, graduate school to work, explaining the problems to be solved, my role in the team, technical choices, problems overcome, etc. The process was interactive, and the interviewer seemed satisfied. However, several consecutive questions were also of this type, giving me the illusion that I was in the wrong room. At the end, I asked: \u0026ldquo;Is this a Technical Judgement Interview?\u0026rdquo; The interviewer was stunned and replied: \u0026ldquo;Yes\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Ok\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; In an instant, I seemed to understand something but also felt I understood nothing. The second Technical Judgement was also a similar situation. Anyway, I thought my performance was okay, and HR\u0026rsquo;s feedback later was also Positive.\nProgram Management Related Knowledge (PgM) Given that the Technical Judgement interview questions were really unexpected, I asked HR again about the details of the PgM interview. HR still replied that the document he gave already had information, so I could only brainstorm by myself. Since the name is Program Management, it should be asking PM-related capabilities, so I should answer more towards the PM role. Sure enough, the interview questions were almost the same as Technical Judgement, and I brought out how I defined Scope, wrote Spec, drove project, and communicated and coordinated during previous projects. The interviewer seemed quite satisfied with my answer. Before ending the interview, we chatted a bit about the intelligence of this position. The interviewer felt that there was a gap with my current experience, but still wished me Good luck.\nGeneral Cognitive Ability (GCA) When it came to GCA, I really couldn\u0026rsquo;t think of how to prepare. If it asks about problem-solving logic, it seems hard to prepare too. Sure enough, this round asked questions similar to the first three rounds. Then I first answered from the execution aspect, but felt the interviewer wasn\u0026rsquo;t very satisfied, so I changed tack and answered from the technical aspect. The interviewer was still not very satisfied and suggested I should answer from a higher-level architecture first. So I gave an answer in this direction, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t think it through thoroughly, and it should be full of bugs. I felt I answered terribly locally. Feeling that I answered poorly, I thick-skinned asked the interviewer for advice at the end. He was also very nice and explained the key points of answering each question to me. The general concept is to first come up with a problem-solving framework, and then fit this framework into the answer framework to answer in order, only then can you hit the scoring points.\nResult Later I scheduled another 1:1 with HR. The result was similar to what I imagined. The previous performance was quite good, mainly failed at GCA. Unable to move forward, I could only go back and wait to see if there are any team match opportunities.\nLater I thought about it, there were indeed many points for improvement in this interview. Besides being really junior now and having too few experiences to talk about, I was not familiar enough with the framework for answering TPM interviews. The framework here refers to:\nWhen facing PgM questions, you can start from the following points in order:\nProject Scope and Organization Project Execution Communication and Influence Clarifying Ambiguous Situations When facing GCA questions, you can start from the following points in order:\nUnderstand the Problem Gather Information Find Solutions Evidence Supporting Solutions Good Communication Next time when attempting Google TPM interview again, I should spend more time polishing the cases on hand, trying to fit them into these frameworks, and then skillfully use these frameworks to answer questions. To some extent, this is also \u0026ldquo;grinding questions\u0026rdquo;.\nConclusion Personally, I feel that the TPM interview is harder and more complex than the SWE interview. Even so, Google seems to want to find people with EECS background and PM capabilities to be TPMs. It\u0026rsquo;s just that there are not many such people or they are not interested, so they can\u0026rsquo;t find anyone. If people with relevant backgrounds are interested, they can try it out.\nIf reading this article helps you, please wish me to get a Google Offer soon passing by.\nAttached is a photo of me freeloading a meal at 101 this year. I really want to enter Google.\n","date":"2023-07-07T12:00:18+08:00","image":"https://i.imgur.com/LH1BGx6.jpg","permalink":"https://www.hugoshih.com/p/2023-google-technical-program-manager-interview-experience/","title":"2023 Google Technical Program Manager Interview Experience"},{"content":"Playing with Vintage Lenses - Hasselblad Carl Zeiss CB 60mm f3.5 Preface In the camera consumer market, the king in lens field besides Leica, Carl Zeiss lenses are also equally outstanding. Zeiss, known as optics giant, through powerful optical design strength developed various classic optical structures dominating until today in 2023.\nMy first Zeiss lens was Distagon ZF 35mm f2 designed for Nikon F mount. Classic retrofocus structure has excellent distortion control. Classic Zeiss T* coating controls contrast and sharpness just right. Just pity huge lens body really hard to accept. Sold this lens after using for a while. Nevertheless, I still looked forward to day returning to Zeiss embrace. So I later was easily pushed into pit of Hasselblad. About how I was pushed into Hasselblad pit can refer to this: Hasselblad A12 Magazine Loading Method.\nSpeaking of Hasselblad, have to mention series of medium format classic lenses Carl Zeiss designed and manufactured for it. Directly let Hasselblad cameras rank among cameras of optical peak. Became artifact for landscape and commercial photography. Even later brought to moon together with lenses. From this can see power of Zeiss lenses.\nIn world of Hasselblad most common is that classic 80mm f2.8 standard lens. Equivalent to about 50mm on medium format. Having larger aperture and familiar and easy to master focal length. Became Hasselblad\u0026rsquo;s most popular entry lens. However I didn\u0026rsquo;t choose this lens. Main reason lies in premium of this lens in market too high. Also focal length too common. I want picture relatively different from others. Just under some coincidence I accidentally bumped into this CB 60mm f3.4. Equivalent 35mm small wide angle meets my needs for street photography. Also this is known as one of sharper lenses in Hasselblad system. Under comprehensive consideration chose this lens as my Hasselblad 500C/M hanging lens.\nMy Hasselblad camera and lens\nIntroduction Zeiss worthy of optics giant. Having classic optical designs to overcome various engineering problems. And Distagon optical structure in Zeiss lens history is as impressive as Biogon, Planar. Distagon is Zeiss\u0026rsquo;s retrofocus structure. Since SLR cameras like Nikon FM2 and Hasselblad must have a mirror behind lens to reflect lens image to viewfinder. Flange distance meaning distance between camera lens mount and focal plane. Will be much longer than rangefinder cameras like Leica. This influence not big for telephoto lenses. Because telephoto lens own design can make last element of lens far from focal plane. However for wide angle lens this is much difficult. Like Schneider classic Angulon design on Leica last element of lens almost sticking to Leica camera shutter curtain. If use this lens on SLR camera definitely will be hit by flipping mirror. Therefore a structure able to move out back focal distance and able to achieve wide angle effect must be invented. Therefore appeared Distagon this kind retrofocus structure.\nLeica\u0026rsquo;s Super-Angulon 21mm f/4 lens1\nRetrofocus structure as name suggests is opposite relative to telephoto structure. Design is based on inverted telescope optical path. Traditional telescope usually uses a set of convex lenses to collect and concentrate light at a point. Then use a set of concave lenses to spread these lights. To magnify image observer sees. However, retrofocus lens design adopts opposite concept. Use a concave mirror at front of lens to collect as wide light as possible. Then concentrate light then expand with convex lens at lens tail. This design allows lens better correct aberration. And able to make incident light closer perpendicular to sensor plane. Thereby providing clearer, more precise image. 2\nLeft is Leica 135mm APO telephoto structure, right is Zeiss Distagon retrofocus structure 34\nHowever disadvantage of retrofocus structure also obvious. Due to need use large amount of lenses to correct. Makes this kind of lens volume relatively large. Comparable to size of telephoto lens. In addition more lenses also bring more aberrations. Wide angle distortion effect retrofocus lens can achieve still not as good as those wide angle lenses designed sticking to focal plane. Therefore later Hasselblad specially designed specialized body for Zeiss Biogon lens which is Hasselblad 903 SWC. From this can see such design still has status Distagon cannot replace. Furthermore like Zeiss Hologon lens with extremely high legendary color. Only used four elements achieved nearly perfect 15mm wide angle structure is genius design. Pity cannot use on SLR camera. And not as practical as Distagon. All in all Distagon structure provides SLR enthusiasts opportunity to explore wide angle world. As long as you don\u0026rsquo;t fear that big and heavy lens.\nHasselblad 903 SWC5\nBack to this Hasselblad CB 60mm f3.5 lens I own. Like most Distagon lenses. This is not a very light lens. Compared to Planar structure 80mm f2.8. Length longer bit. Weight also heavier bit. 60mm focal length equivalent conversion to 135 format about 35mm lens picture. Is an out-and-out small wide angle. Know played Leica know Leica players love 35mm lens. Like Seven Elements, Eight Elements existence like best quality in Leica world. Part comes from 35mm small wide angle characteristic can approach character and record character and surrounding scenery together. Has quite good realistic utility. This kind of lens also naturally positioned as humanity lens. And after actual use this 60mm lens for Hasselblad also indeed feel used to shoot humanity will be better than shooting landscape. And this slightly different from using Hasselblad for landscape photography most people think in heart.\n60mm this focal length not only appears in CB series. From earliest C series lenses to later CF, CFi series can see figure of 60mm f3.5. Except appearance change generation by generation. Optical design inside consistent. And 60mm f3.5 and 100mm f3.5 praised as two sharpest lenses in Hasselblad. Although CB series lens always considered cheap substitute of CF series. Also indeed in shutter function lacks F shutter used for Hasselblad 200F series. But on Hasselblad 500 series usage experience of this lens completely same as CF series. Even optical coating might be more advanced than CF series. Therefore this is still a very great choice under insufficient budget.\nSample Shots Said so much lets see actual shooting appearance\nFirst come a Freedom Square gate shot using Fujifilm Pro400h. Can see still very slight wide angle distortion. And Zeiss optical aesthetic consistent high sharpness and high contrast. Can note rear National Concert Hall red pillars highlighted. Look performance using Fujifilm Provia100f positive film again: Evening sky glowing with aesthetic purple. 60mm small wide angle just enough to collect whole Taipei Main Station McDonald\u0026rsquo;s HK style roast meat shop hanging items. Texture clear after medium focus Scene in traditional market. Brightness of vegetables fruits and characters of sign highlight feature of Zeiss lens. Especially colors of vegetables fruits restored very well. Have to say this lens very suitable for shooting such scene. Medium format own spatial sense plus 60mm small wide angle makes people feel immersed in it\nUsing Hasselblad of course still want be a landscape photographer. Look Pescadores scenery shot with Fujifilm Pro400h below Mediocre Penghu Great Bridge Building on a certain beach on Qimei Island. 60mm lens can blend foreground and background together very well Interesting orange stone pier and blue green sea set off each other. When 60mm lens place horizon in center foreground ground proportion larger This more like lens test. Can see slight distortion at edge Through blending chaos stones foreground and building background. More highlight desolation on island Wide angle lens hard to highlight distant windmill. Sky proportion become too much Finally come two B\u0026amp;W photos under low light. Shot with ILFORD FP4 Make me more determined this is humanity lens no doubt\u0026hellip;\nConclusion Choosing a lens needs consider its application scene. This is also why I love and hate this CB 60mm f3.5. Love it because 35mm is my beloved focal length. I very like humanity, street theme photography. Pity it is a Hasselblad lens. Hasselblad\u0026rsquo;s big and clumsy body destined it is a very time-consuming operation camera. Suitable for slow rhythm photography. And for rapid change of street. I feel Hasselblad hard to adapt. Hasselblad destined to be camera born for landscape, for commercial photography. In such scene small wide angle lens appears not up not down. Not shocking as those ultra wide angle lens picture. Also not able focus on scenery in small range as telephoto lens. Or maybe for me Hasselblad with telephoto lens will be choice more suitable for me. So transferred this lens end of 2022.\nRecord this lens once owned with this article.\nhttps://www.kenrockwell.com/leica/21mm-f4.htm\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://www.getit01.com/p20171220131505/\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://photographylife.com/lenses/leica-apo-telyt-m-135mm-f3-4-asph\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttp://www.hasselbladhistorical.eu/HW/HWLds.aspx\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://lens-db.com/camera/hasselblad-swc-with-carl-zeiss-biogon-t-38mm-f45-c-1959/\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","date":"2023-05-13T23:52:00+08:00","image":"https://i.imgur.com/c5as5mB.jpg","permalink":"https://www.hugoshih.com/p/playing-with-vintage-lenses-hasselblad-carl-zeiss-cb-60mm-f3.5/","title":"Playing with Vintage Lenses - Hasselblad Carl Zeiss CB 60mm f3.5"},{"content":"Nicknames of Taiwanese and Foreign Tech Companies Taiwanese Companies IC Design (Pig Shit House) Item Company Name Ptt, Dcard Nickname Explanation 1 MediaTek (聯發科) Fa Ge (Brother Fa), Fa Di (Brother Fa\u0026rsquo;s younger brother), M, Big M, McDonald\u0026rsquo;s, Duxing Road McDonald\u0026rsquo;s Called Fa Ge when bonuses are high, Fa Di when low.

It has been four months since I left 584 Brigade (2022/10/26~2023/01/06). As time goes by, memories of the army fade away little by little. It is time to record memories of this period.\nPreface This story probably starts from drawing lots at the tail of boot camp. People interested in boot camp experience can read my previous article. Still remember when drawing lots everyone calculated various drawing techniques. Like analyzing units left in lot cylinder. Touching which direction of lot cylinder easier to get good lot etc. Because this batch are all Taipei soldiers. Relatively good lots like Guandu Area Command, Reserve Command etc. units around Taipei. These units easiest to go home on holiday. Bad ones like Matsu Defense Command, Hualien Defense Command these places very troublesome to go home. And like 21 Artillery, 584 Brigade are group not up not down. And unfortunately this part of lots are the most. And I just happened to draw 584 Brigade Supply Soldier.\nBefore going down to unit everyone inquired various information related to drawn unit from squad leader, battalion commander. And 584 is probably that kind of mediocre. Tank battalion, combat unit might be very tired. Food might be good. Sound like not particularly cool unit. Located in Hsinchu Hukou although very close to freeway. But not very easy to go home either. But thinking still have worse Hualien Defense Command. Psychologically more passable.\nSecond day back from boot camp leave. Under mutual farewell of boot camp peers; Carrying heavy Yellow Pu bag and terrible convenience store bread. Sat on bus to 584 Brigade. Actually still one boot camp same bed also drew this unit. Plus same company also had dozen people. This journey not lonely. Bus departed from Taichung Chenggong Ridge at ten something in morning. Three four hours later drove into Hukou camp area. Started my life in 584 Brigade.\nAbout Phase 2 Life Phase 2 life and boot camp are worlds apart. Boot camp had no freedom. While phase 2 had partial freedom. For example: mobile phone. Having mobile phone gave me bit more spiritual solace to survive remaining two and half months.\nTortuous Entry When big bus from Chenggong Ridge slowly drove into camp area in Hukou we thought already arrived our new home. Actually this journey just started. When arrived bus stopped at a assembly ground of 542 Brigade camp area. Watching peers of other buses get off one after another. Doubt started in heart isn\u0026rsquo;t already arrived? About waited ten minutes bus started again. Wonderful thing happened. Bus actually slowly drove out of camp area. At this time suddenly remembered: Hukou has several camp areas. We should be going to another camp area right. Sure enough few minutes later we arrived at 584 Brigade camp area located on other side of Hukou. Came into view are old houses and cafeteria similar to Chenggong Ridge. Can\u0026rsquo;t help OS in heart: where are agreed new barracks\u0026hellip; After stopping we were called off bus to gather at cafeteria. And started assigning units. Also simultaneously observing where called people go. Avoided waiting another period of time finally turn to us. After called out originally thought would walk to our barracks. Result we were arranged to get on a medium tactical vehicle. Followed by confusing situation happened again. We actually left camp area again. At this time suddenly remembered seems officer said 584 Brigade also has a camp area in Taoyuan. Heart shocked: no way, we going to Taoyuan!?\nMedium tactical vehicle drove slowly. Slowly passed through alleys of Hukou. About passed 20 minutes. Medium tactical vehicle drove into a place never thought of: Army Northern Assessment Center. When drove into main gate still couldn\u0026rsquo;t help looking at lot in hand. I drew 584 Brigade that\u0026rsquo;s right. Have to say first impression of Northern Assessment Center is good. Here no gray black houses or camouflage bunkers. Instead red appearance building and large piece of neat beautiful lawn. Compared to army camp here more like a school. Really glad assigned here. No need to endure camp barracks broken to no good like Chenggong Ridge anymore. Later explained by officer. Due to historical factor of 584 Brigade. Combined Arms 2nd Battalion we assigned to temporarily reside in Northern Assessment Center.\nAppearance of Medium Tactical Vehicle About 584 Brigade Army unit of Republic of China guarding Hsinchu County Taiwan. Assigned to Army 6th Corps Command. Armored 584 Brigade team name \u0026ldquo;Dengbu Unit\u0026rdquo;. Predecessor is Army Infantry 284th Division. Before dissolving in Jing-Shi Case this division long term stationed in Kinmen Nanxiong defense area. Therefore also known as \u0026ldquo;Nanxiong Division\u0026rdquo;.\nArmored 584 Brigade. From name know we are an armored vehicle unit. So besides general military vehicles. Unit also has very many armored vehicles and tanks. Armored vehicle mainly responsible for transporting infantry to combat location. Sometimes also provide small amount firepower support. Tank mainly responsible for outputting firepower. Because armored unit here. Every day can hear sound of tanks circling in camp area. Quite spectacular.\nThis is armored vehicle 584 Brigade has another name. Called \u0026ldquo;Dengbu\u0026rdquo; Unit. Legend during Civil War once won battle at Dengbu Island along coast of China. Later awarded name Dengbu. From here also can see 584 Brigade is unit full of history. During service period happened to encounter team anniversary. By the way visited team history museum. Is very special experience. Also deeper understanding of National Army. 584 Brigade also very solid unit. Before coming to Hukou unit stationed in Kinmen. Located at first line of defense. Requirement for combat power very high. And in 80s of Republic era only transferred back to Taiwan stationed in Hsinchu Hukou due to various reasons. Before coming Hukou was originally military important place. Have several brigades stationed here quite crowded. And 584 Brigade considered new neighbor. Therefore only can disperse parasitic in several camp areas of Hukou.\nBattalion I am in called \u0026ldquo;Combined Arms 2nd Battalion\u0026rdquo;. Due to various reasons currently stationed in Army Northern Assessment Center. This place is used for testing combat power. Therefore often see many units lead team come here conduct combat, physical fitness etc. tests. Northern Assessment Center located on Shengli Road Hukou. Most Hukou people should know one side of Shengli Road from north to south all military camps. To arrive here not as easy as Chenggong Ridge. Chenggong Ridge very close to High Speed Rail station. Five minutes drive. Even can arrive by walking. And Hukou camp area distance Hsinchu High Speed Rail station at least twenty minutes drive. Closer station is Hukou Train Station. But speed not as fast as High Speed Rail. After coming out from Hsinchu High Speed Rail station just say to driver want go to first encountered camp area on Shengli Road (but formal name is Hukou 4th Camp Area) fine. Journey will pass section of tortuous climbing. Finally turn onto Shengli Road Hukou. From High Speed Rail station to camp area easier. But from camp area to High Speed Rail station very troublesome. Most time cannot call car. Even called might have to wait twenty thirty minutes. For obligatory service only few holidays want rush back Taipei not very friendly.\nDengbu Team Emblem1\nTroop Type and Unit Allocation Our batch threw to 584 Brigade roughly have following troop types: Rifleman, Clerk, Supply Soldier, Driver. Then what relationship these troop types have with doing things in phase 2? Answer is completely no relationship. Care you drew what soldier. Even if name very handsome 66 rocket soldier arrived phase 2 unit later all are Rifleman. Mainly we in boot camp stage also only received rifle training. So only can operate rifle.\nAlthough said all riflemen. But doing things still somewhat different. And mainly related to assigned unit. You will be assigned to what unit irrelevant to drawn troop type. Purely related to company at time of boot camp. I guess they probably just purely arranged according to unit personnel demand. Therefore boot camp same company people arrived 584 Brigade later also big chance will be in same battalion and same company. Like at boot camp my company was Firepower Company. And most people in Firepower Company who drew to 584 Brigade later also assigned to Combined Arms 2nd Battalion Combat Support Company. Only few people assigned to Combined Arms 2nd Battalion Firepower Company next door. Things done in phase 2 largely related to nature of company. In Combined Arms 2nd Battalion there are companies purely providing firepower like: Firepower Company, Combat 1st Company, Combat 2nd Company\u0026hellip; Also have purely support nature Combat Support Company. Combat Support Company responsible for support work during combat. Besides offensive firepower support also provide like food, medical, communication, maintenance related support. In terms of daily life companies purely providing firepower train more. And Combat Support Company miscellaneous things more. Can be assigned to Combat Support Company is lucky. Every time seeing people of other companies move guns ammunition out prepare war everyday evening move back. Will feel better just do miscellaneous things.\nSince Combat Support Company support affairs many. Therefore internal divided into several platoons. Each platoon responsible for one business (food, medical, communication, maintenance). And platoon I assigned called Battalion Headquarters Platoon. Mainly assisting battalion officers handle various miscellaneous things. I in period contacted like help officer serve food, clean hygiene, photocopy data, build command post etc. Not considered very heavy difficult work. However because will contact battalion officer first line. Doing things how to make battalion officer happy is very important.\nPhase 2 Must Bring Things Phase 2 suddenly much more can do own things. Life no longer simple like boot camp. Therefore much more demands.\nConsumption Small Change - Phase 2 will suddenly have many opportunities can use money. You will have lot of time can go to camp store (basically rest time can go. As long as camp store opens). Camp store besides various snacks drinks let you feel beauty of outside world. Also hot food section. If don\u0026rsquo;t want eat lunch provided by kitchen can also try fried noodles, braised pork rice, fried chicken leg of camp store. These mostly pay cash. Bring one two hundred yuan few days will spend. In addition some squad leaders very nice to voluntary service. Also willing help obligatory service take out outside food. You think yesterday eat KFC today eat Pizza hut. This is thing completely unimaginable when new recruit. EasyCard with Automatic Reload - That kind integrated EasyCard is simply Doraemon\u0026rsquo;s magic tool. Besides partial vending machines can use. Camp store, or further walk to OK convenience store in 542 Brigade camp area can use EasyCard. Buy whatever want buy. Very convenient. Food Instant Noodles - When your action range expand to whole Hukou camp area. Almost no daily necessities cannot buy. Instant noodles same logic. However if have specific flavor want eat still can bring in from outside beforehand stock. Late night making cup noodle in dormitory really evil. Occasionally take instant noodle honor officer build relationship also can exchange little bit relax. Snacks - Same logic. Most snacks also can buy. Most time you will lazy walk so far go buy things. So bring in early stock more convenient. Also can sell to neighbor. Drinks - Drink choices in camp area less. And still have many that kind strange drinks completely never seen outside. Relatively that kind tetra pak drink choice also less. Only OK has small amount. If want drink specific models also suggest bring back when returning from holiday. Clothing Jacket - Usually training time cannot wear own jacket. Except morning assembly and exercise time. My phase 2 time is November to January. This period Hsinchu wind big and cold. Really need have a warm jacket. New recruit issued white green jacket really sucks. If entering camp in winter must bring. Warm Clothing - Enter camp in winter must bring. Especially weather particularly cold few days night sleeping really will be cold protect. So some thick long pants or thermal underwear very necessary. Sneakers - Phase 2 exercise time also can wear own sneakers. So if feel issued shoes hard to wear or worn out. Then can also bring own sneakers in. Sport Shorts - Boot camp sport shorts only issued one. Because wear shorts every day. So usually wash once a week very disgusting. Phase 2 exercise time can wear own shorts. Usually can prevent one pants wear several days situation. Own pants also more comfortable. Laundry Powder - Boot camp wash clothes is clothes to wash use laundry bag concentrate find outside vendor unify send wash. Phase 2 due to such demand not big. Default is directly use washing machine on camp wash self. Then of course laundry powder part have to bring self. However our phase 2 peer obligatory service more. Discussed with officer want unify send wash. So later officer also help us find vendor handle. No need self grab washing machine someone help wash good really convenient. Tableware Bowl - Phase 2 finish restaurant tableware will unify recycle keep. Phase 2 bowls plates etc. self keep. If feel meal tray provided by camp hard use, hard wash. Can also bring big bowl self. Loading dish loading rice will convenient much. Bedding Quilt - Folding quilt definitely most painful thing when soldier wake up. Boot camp requirement for quilt high strive for edges and corners. Spend twenty thirty minutes folding quilt not exaggeration. Phase 2 no longer will have officer want you must spread quilt. Or you basically can directly cover own quilt. Daytime put back quilt completely never spread. Own quilt stuff back into internal affairs cabinet. Many Power Banks - Our company rule is night can use extension cord connect phone charger charge. But daytime only use power bank charge. Never underestimate phone usage. Since too boring in camp area. One day phone usage time is ten hours start. Naturally power bank also carry along. Usually have two power banks can ensure everyday at least one power bank has electricity. Power Adapter - Want charge phone or power bank then of course need that kind 110v to type-c adapter. Best bring few more backup avoid missing. Wired Earphone - In army principle cannot bring bluetooth earphone. Only can bring wired earphone. Phase 2 earphone also use anytime. Besides talk phone with family girlfriend use. Bored want low profile watch drama, watch youtube also very useful. Just wear earphone in training time be sure low profile. Seen by officer still will angry. Also earphone also suggest bring few more. Since usage chance many. Broken chance also many. I in camp area had accidentally pull break one. Again no prepare backup. Cause that week want talk phone or watch video become very troublesome. Medicine Cold Medicine - Once arrive phase 2 suddenly become easily catch cold. Possibly chance stay in closed space with neighbor increase. When catch cold although Northern Assessment Center has infirmary. But medical officer quite useless. Besides prescribe some comprehensive cold medicine only will transfer. So if symptom not too serious then eat cold medicine self fine. Mosquito Repellent - Phase 2 officer also won\u0026rsquo;t require you must hang mosquito net. Although night sleep window will close. But inevitably have mosquito sneak in and drive not away. At this time only can rely on mosquito repellent or some anti-itch medicine. Daily Schedule Compared to boot camp every link planned well. Phase 2 life relatively much flexible. Except assembly time very fixed. Daily assembly time, rest time, eating time not that fixed. Mostly will different according to daily training, business content. Compared boot camp that kind every minute every second very critical life. Phase 2 really pressure small much. Daily schedule roughly as follows:\n06:00 Wake Up - Our phase 2 time is according to winter time. Wake up time compare summer time 05:30 can have 30 minutes more sleep time. Phase 2 unlike boot camp will wake up earlier 30 minutes. Anyway requirement for quilt not high. Morning about spend ten minutes can settle quilt and wash. 06:20 Assembly - After wash can slowly move to assembly ground assemble. This assembly wear usual exercise uniform fine. Unlike boot camp only obligatory service assemble. Yesterday duty stay obligatory service will also assemble. Watching obligatory service also look sleepy very interesting. This assembly is duty squad leader roughly look person missing or not. Not missing squad leader mood good bring everyone do some exercise. But most time directly release everyone go down eat breakfast. Suggest steal bowl chopsticks stuff into pocket bring down when assemble. So no need run back dormitory one more trip. 06:00 ~ 06:30 Eat Breakfast - Compared to boot camp too many people restaurant cannot sit. Phase 2 after breakfast time restaurant super empty. Voluntary service have outside eating sleeping rarely come in eat breakfast. We obligatory service sometimes also want go back steal sleep. Also not necessarily want eat. 584 Brigade breakfast beginning come very delicious. Later don\u0026rsquo;t know why worse and worse. Only left steamed bun, few small dishes, porridge, and sweet soup. Mediocre. 07:30 Assembly - This assembly want full gear (helmet, S-belt). Then will conduct singing counting numbers. That is first come few singing counting numbers. Then lead sing military song like \u0026ldquo;Army in Charge\u0026rdquo;. 07:30 ~ 11:00 Training Class - See what schedule of day is. Since our unit experiencing pre-base training. Therefore quite a lot training content targeting down base like CPR, combat injury rescue, night vision goggles etc. Mainly still train voluntary service. Obligatory service beside fill number. No class then maintain gun in Zhongshan room or slide phone be redundant. Occasionally called out help. 11:00 ~ 12:00 Lunch - Different from boot camp. Lunch before no longer assemble. Just after class respective return dormitory unload gear take bowl chopsticks then self go restaurant eat. Finish eat self return rest. Lunch compared boot camp quite good. Usually have two to three main dishes. Then dish amount also very sufficient. Won\u0026rsquo;t have dish not enough situation in boot camp. In addition one sweet one salty soup can choose. Sometimes have add dish. Can eat something different like hot pot. 12:00 ~ 13:30 Nap - Nap just return dormitory rest sleep. Don\u0026rsquo;t mess do whatever want do. No one will care you. 13:30 Assembly - Same also full gear. Again one more time singing counting numbers. Sometimes noon have duty (wash meal bucket kind work) can makeup rest until two o\u0026rsquo;clock. Can upstairs dormitory steal listen downstairs how this military song sing. Obligatory service since often practice all can sing. But voluntary service since usually busy all not quite can sing. Overall depend on obligatory service pull high average value otherwise will be scolded by battalion duty officer. 14:10 ~ 16:00 Training Class - Continue doing things similar to morning. 16:00 ~ 17:00 Exercise - Different from boot camp. Phase 2 has exercise time. Sometimes company commander mood good will come lead physical training. Otherwise usually run then go basketball court play ball. Really quite healthy life. Later I and few peers will long run to 542 camp area together. About three kilometers. Way back drop by Hi-Life steal buy something. 17:00 ~ 18:00 Dinner - Eating same things as lunch. However voluntary service since have outside eating sleeping. So people eat not many. 18:00 ~ 19:00 Washing Up - See you want wash bath this time or not. Not wash later also have chance. Not anxious. 19:00 Assembly - This assembly only assemble obligatory service see person missing or not. Then find some things give obligatory service do at night. Most time just practice military song practice one hour or clean environment. Meet better duty squad leader assemble finish directly release us down rest. 19:00 ~ 20:00 Night Class - Same as above. Just practice military song and clean. More special have night march and night shooting. But only each once. But is very rare experience. 20:00 ~ 22:00 Free Time - Same just do whatever want. At this time not washed yet go wash. Otherwise rot in dormitory. Watch youtube, play phone, find girlfriend chat. 22:00 Bedtime - Bedtime turn off light. However want sleep or not is your business. Want play phone until dawn also fine. Sometimes also will ask outside eating sleeping voluntary service bring some good food from outside in this time eat. https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%AD%E8%8F%AF%E6%B0%91%E5%9C%8B%E9%99%B8%E8%BB%8D%E8%A3%9D%E7%94%B2%E7%AC%AC%E4%BA%94%E5%85%AB%E5%9B%9B%E6%97%85\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","date":"2023-05-05T17:05:31+08:00","image":"https://i.imgur.com/jGwuusU.jpg","permalink":"https://www.hugoshih.com/p/hukou-armored-584-brigade-combined-arms-2nd-battalion-phase-2-training-reflection/","title":"Hukou Armored 584 Brigade Combined Arms 2nd Battalion Phase 2 Training Reflection"},{"content":"Google Taiwan Campus Talk, 2023 Hiring Event Livestream Date: 2022/11/11 Title: Google Taiwan Campus Talk, 2023 Hiring Event Agenda: Topic Speaker Welcome \u0026amp; Google Culture Hear more from the Googlers Fireside Chat with all the Recording: Made by Google: Behind the Scenes Livestream Date: 2022/11/5 Title: Taiwan Made by Google: Behind the Scenes 2022 Agenda: Topic Speaker Next-gen Google Tensor processor Fireside Chat : Pixel Camera Live Q\u0026amp;A and Latest Opportunities @Google Taiwan Recording: Google Taiwan Platforms Team Introduction \u0026amp; Hiring Event Date: 2022/07/08 Title: 2022 Google Taiwan Platforms Team Face to Face Agenda: Topic Speaker Google Taiwan Platforms Team at a glance Director Platforms HW Test/Quality \u0026amp; Eng Labs Software \u0026amp; Hardware Engineers in Google Taiwan Platforms Team Hardware \u0026amp; Software Managers Google Hiring Process \u0026amp; Tips Recruiter All You Want to Know - Q\u0026amp;A \u0026amp; See You at Google!

While the memory is not too distant, I record my impressions and thoughts on boot camp.\nPreface To be honest, until the month before I served in the army, I really didn\u0026rsquo;t think I would come in to serve as a regular soldier. At least since the physical examination, I maintained that after a few more re-examinations, I should be able to use flat feet to be a twelve-day supplementary soldier. In January of this year (2022), I got several pre-employment R\u0026amp;D alternate service offers, and probably thought that after graduation I should just go to the substitute service camp to sing songs and prepare to go to work. Later, I decided to go to a foreign company without R\u0026amp;D alternate service, and still felt that there should be a chance to be a supplementary soldier, because in August and September, my BMI once soared over 29, not far from the supplementary soldier standard. Who knew that later trapped in the deep waters of graduate school, a conscription order became the graduation password. Thinking about it is also absurd, never thought that one day I would look forward to the arrival of the conscription order so much.\nIn my echo chamber, most people disapprove of spending four months serving in the army. Those who have served all think it is a waste of time, pulling weeds or cleaning every day, plus watching a group of idiot officers play tricks. Those with a master\u0026rsquo;s degree will also think that going to serve as R\u0026amp;D substitute service or even six months of general substitute service is better than four months without freedom. People who haven\u0026rsquo;t served might be able to say things like four months will pass quickly. Once you actually come in, you will regret how time can pass so slowly. Even now with only the last month left, I still feel that coming in is mostly a waste of time, only receiving 6000 yuan per month, which is really tragic compared to the salary outside.\nUnexpectedly, my family was unusually excited about serving in the army. In their traditional concept, serving in the army is the real coming-of-age ceremony. For young people who think about going abroad all day, this may be the last chance to cultivate patriotism and love for the people. Plus the increasingly bloated figure during graduate school, going in for exercise should be friendly to health. Later when the conscription order came down and they knew I was going to Chenggong Ridge for boot camp, my father was even more excited. He served as an obligatory sergeant at Chenggong Ridge for nearly two years back then. Chenggong Ridge is a place where he invested his youth and is full of memories. It\u0026rsquo;s a pity that there is no family visit, otherwise it would be a good opportunity for him to come back and reminisce.\nFrom knowing that I might have a chance to serve in the army, to confirming which batch I was assigned to, and then getting the conscription order, all this happened within a month. There was no time to think, no time to change mindset. After discussing with the professor, I started running the graduation process. In between, stuck a five-day trip to Penghu, so that I was still arranging the oral defense time at night in the homestay. Returned from Penghu and spent a week completing the oral defense and leaving school procedures, and got the diploma on 9/19. Then three days later, on 9/21, I boarded the enlistment special train to Chenggong Ridge and started four months (16 weeks) of military life.\nPreparation Since being busy with graduation was already overwhelming enough, I waited until I got my diploma to start thinking about serving in the army. Compared to some peers who may have waited for the conscription order for half a year, my preparation time was relatively very short. I roughly divided the preparation part into items and mentality, both are equally important.\nEssential Items Someone on the Internet said that you can actually enlist with just a wallet, because whatever you will use can be bought or obtained inside. This is true, but if you want to be more comfortable, it is better to prepare more things.\nToiletries Toothbrush - Recommend bringing a few more. I brought an old one for the first week and it broke after two days, I could only ask for help from peers. Toothpaste - Bring a bigger tube, better than having none to use. 3-in-1 Shower Gel - Adidas is good to use, convenient is good, don\u0026rsquo;t be too particular. Electric Shaver - Before going in, someone said electric ones cannot be brought. Chenggong Ridge seems to allow it. Much more convenient than manual ones. Towel - No need to bring, the railing by the bed can only hang the officially issued one. Clothing Underwear - Recommend bringing some more. Although there are issued ones, you may not be used to wearing them. Sometimes you may not be able to wash them on the same day. Undershirt - No need to bring, can only wear issued camouflage undershirt. Warm Clothing - When the weather is cold, you can wear thermal underwear or a jacket inside the camouflage jacket. Casual Clothes - You can only wear casual clothes when going out for holidays. Laundry Bag - No need to bring, will be issued inside. Medicine Vitamins - Can bring some Vitamin B or C. Can eat some when it\u0026rsquo;s tiring, recover faster. Analgesic Antipyretic Tablets - Very often catch a cold and have a headache inside, can eat a little to relieve symptoms. Band-Aid - Can use for injuries or blisters. Salonpas Spray - Can use for muscle soreness. Peppermint Oil - Can use for headache. Miscellaneous Wet Wipes - Bring cooling wet wipes, it\u0026rsquo;s a godsend when the weather is hot. Wiping once before nap makes it easy to sleep. Books - Most of the time inside is spent waiting. Taking books out to read usually won\u0026rsquo;t be a problem. Power Bank - Although time using mobile phone is very little, having a power bank can prevent phone from running out of power. Baby Powder - Can use when weather is hot. Small Fan - It is usually very hot inside the mosquito net, and most of the time the air conditioning cannot blow in. Flashlight - Usually need to get up early in the morning to organize internal affairs, but cannot turn on the light, can only rely on flashlight. Earplugs - Must bring for target practice, and easy to lose. Not wearing earplugs for target practice will make your ears ring for a week, I experienced it personally. Pen - Ballpoint pen and permanent marker are needed. Better to have more because they are often lost. Used for writing Big Soldier diary or filling out forms. Food Drinks - Usually not allowed to buy drinks from vending machines first few days after entering. Snacks - Same logic, eat some when homesick. Chewing Gum - Can eat when bored, but don\u0026rsquo;t be too high profile. Documents Original Conscription Order - Will be very troublesome if not brought. Copy of Diploma - Just bring the highest degree, because degree will be used to distinguish drawing lots batches. Certificate of Service Period Deduction - This needs to be applied for at the school military instruction office. Best to get it done before going in. Copy of Household Certificate - Wasn\u0026rsquo;t used later. Personal Chop - Spend some money to carve one, will be collected after entering. Money Miscellaneous Fees - First week will collect a lot of money, like laundry fee, hair cutting fee, issued items fee etc. Small Change - Will be used for vending machines and making phone calls. Phone Card - Don\u0026rsquo;t think there are many opportunities to use mobile phone. In boot camp stage you can only rely on phone card to contact outside world. Calling mobile phone is very expensive, suggest preparing more. Mentality Adjustment This is very difficult\nFirst of course is to convince yourself why you are here to serve these four months. Then is to understand what is done in each stage in the army, can relieve fear of ignorance. Before enlisting I kept watching Ah Zhe Soldier videos, inside explains very clearly what happens every week in boot camp. Knowing more can convince yourself that the most painful part has passed. Then can chat more with friends who have finished serving, understand how to relieve depression, how to get along with peers and officers. I feel my mentality wasn\u0026rsquo;t completely adjusted when I went in, and also spent a lot of time adapting to the rhythm inside. Also, never bring outside things inside to complete, like preparing for exams, applying for schools or completing research etc. You will find that you can\u0026rsquo;t do anything inside. That sense of powerlessness is terrible. Life I can verify positively that boot camp is absolutely the most, most, most painful period of time in the four months, especially the first ten days after entering. After surviving it, it will be like eating sugarcane, getting sweeter and smoother.\nAbout Chenggong Ridge and 101 Brigade My Unit My assigned batch is Army 158T Military Training Service, assigned unit is 101 Brigade 4th Battalion Firepower Company. It is said it is called Firepower Company because we are the fourth infantry company in this battalion. To avoid the word four, it was renamed Firepower Company. In the past it was called Weapons Company, don\u0026rsquo;t know why it was changed to Firepower Company.\nThere are about 150 military training soldiers in the company. Company level has Company Commander, Political Warfare Officer, Company Sergeant Major. Those responsible for managing us are several sergeants below Staff Sergeant taking turns being on duty. Can observe that the company is often understaffed, often only two or three sergeants managing 150 soldiers. Can be said to be willing but unable, often feel hard for them.\nAbout Chenggong Ridge Chenggong Ridge is an old boot camp center. The entire camp area is responsible for receiving new recruits. Very, very few combat units. Can feel that equipment in Chenggong Ridge is older, more biased towards training purposes.\nTraditionally Chenggong Ridge has 302 and 104 two brigades. Later after 101 Brigade was reinstated, it borrowed the original 104 Brigade barracks to station. Chenggong Ridge camp area is very large. Unless there are special reasons, moving around is by foot. When practicing target shooting, often walk from 104 to 302, takes about 30 minutes, and have to wear full gear with heavy T65k2 rifle. Very tiring.\nThe first floor of barracks usually has vending machines. This is the only place where we can freely buy things. There are also several camp stores and convenience stores inside the camp area. These are usually visible but not reachable. Only when going out for official duty can beg officers to take us there. So people who finished official duty will have bulging pockets.\nChenggong Ridge also has a substitute service training class. Usually pass by on the way to target practice. But suggest not to observe their life, mood will be bad. Their life is colorful, while ours is camouflage\u0026hellip;\nTransportation in Chenggong Ridge is very, very convenient compared to other camp areas. Ten minutes walk from the main gate to Chenggong Train Station. Spending fifty yuan to take a taxi, can reach High Speed Rail station within ten minutes. In addition, thousands of people go out together when Chenggong Ridge has a holiday. Many people and there is a level crossing right at the gate. To prevent clogging when going out the gate, usually run out. Very spectacular.\nEnlistment On enlistment day, gathered at Taipei Main Station lobby. After gathering, people from district office will send everyone to the special train to Chenggong Ridge. That process is unforgettable forever. Hundreds of sad-faced boys gathered in the lobby, one look and you know what suffering they are going to encounter.\nThe enlistment special train is a Ju-Guang train that drives very slowly. Slow enough to have time to eat a very terrible bento in the middle. Please remember this bento, because this will be the only warm food from the outside world you can eat for these ten days. About three hours later the train will arrive at New Wuri Station. Transfer to bus directly into Chenggong Ridge camp area. Then will gather and be assigned to respective companies.\nFollowed by assigning seat numbers. Everyone will circulate rumors to stand back as much as possible, don\u0026rsquo;t stand in the front row, because will be squad leader. I just happened to become number 005. The schedule on the first day will be very tight. First is security check (body search), arranging organization, issuing equipment, arranging beds, simply teaching everyone how to organize internal affairs. From this time on we have to say goodbye to our mobile phones, start primitive life.\nEnlistment Special Train\nSchedule Life in the unit is very regular. If there are no special things, daily schedule is about the same. Therefore quite easy to grasp what will happen next. During boot camp period we live on summer time. Daily schedule is roughly as follows:\n05:30 Wake Up - Although schedule says wake up at this time, usually have to get up earlier to fold quilt, mosquito net and wash up. These jobs actually take quite some time. 05:50 Assembly - If nothing special, wear sports uniform and go downstairs to assemble at company assembly ground (the open space at barracks entrance). Suggest going down ten minutes earlier, because 05:50 is time for assembly completion, but someone is late every time. 06:00 ~ 06:30 Breakfast - Because many people, cafeteria cannot sit everyone, so we will split into two batches for cafeteria. When one batch goes to eat, the other batch will do environment cleaning. Breakfast usually is a bun with some dishes and tea. Occasionally there will be things like hamburgers. 07:00 Assembly - This assembly requires full gear (helmet, S-belt). 07:10 ~ 10:30 Training Class - Will have class according to schedule of the day. Things learned are mostly things that will be tested in assessment. 11:00 Assembly - Yes, you will find you did nothing and going to eat again. 11:00 ~ 12:00 Lunch - Lunch has four dishes and one soup plus fruit. Standard is about same as elementary school nutritious lunch. 12:30 ~ 13:50 Nap - Since nothing to do can only sleep or read books. I usually go make a public phone call to girlfriend before nap. 14:00 Assembly - Same also full gear. 14:10 ~ 16:30 Training Class - Continue doing things similar to morning. 17:00 Assembly - Time to eat again. 17:00 ~ 18:00 Dinner - Eating same things as lunch. Dishes often not enough to eat. 18:00 ~ 19:00 Washing Up - At this time everyone will rush to grab showers. 150 people rushing for 20 showers easily causes traffic jam. Also will set up mosquito net on bed, to make sleeping time faster at night. 19:00 Assembly - By this time most people finished showering. Wear sports uniform and assemble. Sometimes in Zhongshan room sometimes on company assembly ground. 19:00 ~ 21:00 Night Class - Most of the time doing some very redundant things. Like collecting some money, data or issuing equipment. Other time just spacing out. Occasionally will give mobile phones, but probability is very low. Duty Officer The duty officer of the week will largely determine if you live comfortably that week. Duty rotation order will be published on schedule. Can know who is on duty next, be mentally prepared. Duty officer usually hands over on Thursday afternoon. Each time there will be a Company Duty Officer responsible for leading training progress, there will be a Duty Squad Leader responsible for roll call and managing unit order. Being on duty feels like a very tiring job. One or two people manage 150 soldiers often cannot take care of everything. Officers on duty all want to get out quickly.\nGood duty officer has clear standards, strict in appropriate situations, won\u0026rsquo;t play with soldiers arbitrarily. Bad duty officer has inconsistent standards, poor efficiency, drag everyone\u0026rsquo;s rest time. The week when it\u0026rsquo;s turn for bad or inexperienced duty officer will be smoky and full of complaints.\nWelfare Things that are taken for granted outside will be a kind of welfare inside.\nRest Time - Don\u0026rsquo;t doubt, they treat giving soldiers rest as a kind of welfare. You have to be more obedient to give you more rest time. Please remember the famous saying from squad leader\u0026rsquo;s mouth: \u0026ldquo;You cooperate with me, I cooperate with you, your rest time will only become more and more.\u0026rdquo; Vending Machine - Although there are vending machines downstairs every building, doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean we have right to use vending machines. Officers will open vending machines depending on order. We started having right to use vending machines on third day. And not all vending machines can be used, only can use vending machine belonging to own company. Smoking - I don\u0026rsquo;t smoke, but share anyway. Smoking is also a welfare. Our company let people smoke on the second day. Everyone is afraid some people will start naughty without cigarettes. Smoking time is usually after lunch and dinner, gather at a place to smoke collectively. Since lighters are prohibited items, can only get from squad leader. Scene of dozen people borrowing fire from each other is very interesting. Mobile Phone - Too little mobile phone time should be the place everyone most dissatisfied. We should only use mobile phone once or twice a week, about ten to twenty minutes each time. Usually when mobile phone cannot be used, locked in phone cabinet. Can see but cannot touch. In this era people addicted to mobile phones should be more than people addicted to cigarettes. Should be reasonable to give mobile phone opportunity comparable to smoking. Mobile phone needs to install National Army MDM to be used in camp area. Will help everyone install first few days. MDM software will lock camera and GPS. Can unlock after going out of camp area on holiday. Suggest trying not to bring non-ios phones in. MDM will be harder to install. Sometimes will affect your precious mobile phone usage time. Camp Store - Chenggong Ridge has three or four camp stores. Except for first day when taken collectively to buy daily necessities, likely won\u0026rsquo;t have opportunity to go again, unless on official duty. Chenggong Ridge recently renovating, so many moving things and cleaning jobs need manpower. Most of the time halfway through work officer will take us to camp store to buy something. Considered an unwritten welfare. Punishment Where there is welfare there is punishment. And punishment can be collective or individual. Collective punishment is commonly known as Collective Responsibility. Several people in group behave poorly, will sequentially deprive above collective punishments. Let those few people be hated by everyone. For occasional especially disorderly behavior will have individual punishment. However since Hung Chung-chiu incident, corporal punishment is explicitly prohibited in army. Using running, push-ups etc. as punishment are all very serious behaviors. Should be no officer dare to take this risk. So adopt more static punishment methods. Below list punishment methods they can adopt:\nConfession Letter - This is first step of all punishments. Is a blank form asking you to write what bad things you did. After writing officer will punish further according to situation. Sometimes might just be bird things like clothes not worn, assembly late. To make up a thousand words is also painful enough. So often hear squad leader say: \u0026ldquo;Whoever XXX again send one confession letter each person, do what I say\u0026rdquo; 08 - If did something relatively serious wrong like late returning from holiday, mostly punishment start from holiday time. When we were in boot camp mostly could leave camp before Friday 18:00. Being punished 08 means can only leave camp next day 08:00. Thinking of sleeping alone in huge dormitory feels pitiful. Penalty Duty - If you are 08 holiday that week, but you did foolish thing again, then might be penalty duty. Penalty duty once two hours. So you might become 10:00 to leave camp. Every minute of freedom outside is important when serving in army. Never joke with your holiday. If reached illegal level, it is said directly forced to stay in camp until discharge, also accept military law trial. So never do bad things.\nActivity Space In boot camp stage, new recruits have completely no freedom. All our free activity space is limited to the floor belonging to company, including corridor toilet and dormitory. And only can move during rest time. Wanting to go downstairs or move to other places in camp area must be led by officer. Otherwise being spotted will be big trouble.\nIn addition, between companies, between battalions have very clear boundaries. Like cannot use toilet of other companies, cannot walk stairs of other companies, cannot cross central corridor of other battalions, walk assembly ground of other battalions etc.\nInternal Affairs In boot camp stage everything has to be regulated. Where to put what things how to put, how to fold quilt, what things can put cannot put etc. Order of shoe tray shoes cannot be wrong. Washbasin can only put toothbrush toothpaste. Toothbrush must be inserted in steel cup dirty enough used by unknown number of people. Direction facing must be same side. Towel can only hang officially issued label facing inside. In inner affairs cabinet clothes can only hang jackets and camouflage uniforms. Sleeves also need to be tied up. Cabinet top can only put helmet and S-belt. Mosquito net and quilt have fixed folding method. Edges and corners need to be pulled square like tofu. Only thing can be messy is inside Yellow Pu bag. If above not done well considered internal affairs not tidy. Too messy then sorry 08.\nRecruitment Obligatory service is key recruitment target of National Army. At beginning of boot camp people from other units will come to camp to persuade everyone to sign voluntary service. They will come to introduce their unit location work and welfare. Usually will put on good food eaten everyday and newly built barracks to attract everyone. Also will promote stability of National Army salary and benefits of pension. In addition will also say now National Army all have eating and sleeping outside. Similar to working outside. However whether it is really so good is left for people who really signed to experience. Only know very few people can endure humiliation and burden for twenty years.\nWhole recruitment link luck good will last two three days. These few days no need training class. If you show willingness to sign after hearing, recruiter will pull you out for interview separately. Sometimes will even give you mobile phone, go to camp store etc. benefits. In addition if you almost decided to sign, first holiday can release 12 holiday i.e. leave camp Friday noon. Saying let you go convince parents let you sign. So also quite a lot of people pretend want to sign during this period. Try to get some benefits.\nAfter recruitment period ends will see peers who signed can enjoy various benefits like using mobile phone during rest time, playing ball time. Sometimes also no need to follow training class. Can only say National Army uses every means to attract everyone to join. But no need to envy them too much. They just cool for these few days. After phase two down to unit is another world.\nHoliday Holiday is the only chance for obligatory service to return to society outside. Unlike voluntary service occasionally can eat and sleep outside a bit. Obligatory service holiday in principle is rest when see red. So consecutive holidays rest as usual, make-up work make-up as usual. Boot camp first ten days no holiday. Afterward will make up two days holiday back. So first ten days are most painful. No freedom no mobile phone information completely separated from outside world. Our batch luckier just met Double Ten consecutive holiday. Plus two days holiday not taken. Our first three holidays were all consecutive three days. Considering this batch are all Taipei soldiers. Distance far. First three holidays also let us off 18 holiday. Therefore there were few weeks only trained four days class. Already lived quite well compared to other batches. Only last week off 08 holiday. Result caused public anger of peers. But military training service holiday time originally is Saturday 08. So nothing good to argue.\nChenggong Ridge holiday in and out all walk main gate. That is the section with road to success sign. Holiday will collectively lead team walk from barracks to main gate. Will first divide into taking taxi, Chenggong Train Station, parent pickup three blocks lead team separately. If going to High Speed Rail station walk taxi route. Then take taxi to High Speed Rail station 50 yuan per person. Short five minutes journey one car full can carry seven people. Actually quite profitable. High Speed Rail round trip Taipei is 700. So monthly 6000 yuan actually not quite enough for fare.\nReturning from holiday enter from another closer gate. Suggest arriving Taichung High Speed Rail station early. Sometimes many people no taxi. And taxi cannot drive directly to gate. Only can drop off near gate. Remaining section of road walk in about 20 minutes. So try to be early for everything. Late returning from holiday is very serious. Also don\u0026rsquo;t make trouble on road walking into camp area. Will have officers patrolling. Being spotted also confession letter one sheet.\nTraining Class Since boot camp time is very short, training class items focus on assessment items. Basic attire for training class is helmet + S-belt. Most training classes not tiring. About junior high school PE class level. And after some incidents officers also don\u0026rsquo;t dare to train soldiers randomly. You propose (dizziness, foot pain etc.) basically will let you rest. Going to toilet same just say will let you go. They also afraid you complain him. Weather influence more terrible than officers. Didn\u0026rsquo;t encounter rain in Chenggong Ridge. Considered very lucky. Heard other units individual combat in rain. Getting mud all over body. Summer sun is terrible. Can only rely on drinking water to cool down. Training classes I experienced roughly have following:\nOpening Ceremony Fifth day just entered will have an opening ceremony. Is bringing all Chenggong Ridge new recruits to assembly ground to sunbathe. Will have high officials like Brigade Commander to watch. During period will have to read some soldier oath. To proceed opening smoothly. Will spend whole morning practicing organizing team and standing at attention. Sun still very big in September. Should be quite a lot of people heatstroke from sun.\nBayonet Charge Bayonet charge can be said to be most important item of assessment. But compared to target practice, individual combat actually quite useless. Same set of things hasn\u0026rsquo;t changed for thirty forty years. This era on battlefield also should be very hard to rely on bayonet technique to stab enemy to death. Understanding as a team performance might be more acceptable. Can show team tacit understanding and morale. Can refer to Rookie Diary Bayonet Charge clip.\nBayonet charge whole performance about five minutes. Will take about three to four mornings to practice. Will see group of people holding T65k2 rifles turning around shouting \u0026ldquo;Kill!\u0026rdquo;. Most terrible part of practicing bayonet charge lies in extending hand straight to hold gun when stabbing gun out. When practicing continuous movement squad leader sometimes deliberately doesn\u0026rsquo;t call next movement. Rifle very heavy. About four kilograms. Maintaining state of stabbing gun out tests arm muscle endurance very much. Hand can be sour for several days after practice. In addition team tacit understanding also needs time to cultivate. Like scattering and assembling. Also bayonet charge flow needs to be familiar. Watching other companies stab can still see people stab wrong side, slow half beat or run wrong place when positioning.\nGrenade Grenade throwing can be divided into two parts: basic throwing and field throwing. Basic throwing is simpler. Just throw a practice grenade about 500 grams into a fan-shaped area then lie down. Actually throwing is quite difficult. Small practice grenade heavier than imagined. Usually if not throwing things, hard to apply force correctly will throw not far. Therefore some people can easily throw very far some people throw very hard still not into 25 meters. Training class will first explain steps and throwing method. But no one understands. Actually as long as can throw out. Movement random throw also fine. But surely remember to lie down. Not lie down will definitely be blasted by squad leader. Grenade class considered very relaxed. Only one venue. One company 150 people one person go up throw one or two times three hours passed. Other time just sit on bench watch others throw.\nMore interesting is sometimes go compete throwing grenade with other companies. Will pick few stronger ones from company to represent. Lose whole company do push-ups 30 times. Once won squad leader even treated people who went up to throw drinks. Considered more interesting part in boredom.\nField is to throw grenade into a square window. Simulating situation of attacking enemy hiding place in actual combat. Field throwing very hard to throw in without practice. After all only touched practice grenade once or twice. To accurately control throwing direction and force very difficult. Remember only five or six people in whole company really threw in.\nTarget Practice Target practice uses National Army T65K2 rifle to shoot human-shaped target. Can be divided into 25 meters zeroing shooting and 175 meters shooting. Distance farther shooting difficulty higher. Boot camp target practice all adopt prone position. But heard actually not much used in actual combat.\nBecause guns plus bullets are very dangerous. Range strictly requires discipline. Cannot laugh play sleep randomly. Also have to be very familiar with shooting flow. Therefore before target practice will do shooting preview several times. Which is simulating target practice flow. Including how to prone shoot correctly, how to open safety, how to aim, how to press gun, how to load bullets, how to clear check gun. And commands on range like what left line ready right line ready.\nMake sure everyone knows then will take to range for formal shooting. Battalion commander company commander will all be there when target shooting. Usually company commander serves as shooting commander. Will give shooting commands. Range usually has several target positions. One target position corresponds to one human-shaped target. Beside target position will have range assistant assist shooting. Help catch shell casing hand magazine and prevent you from doing outrageous foolish things. Before going up to shoot will arrange wave target position. Shoot wave by wave up target platform. Each time will shoot about one to three magazines. Each time about six bullets. Thought gun recoil huge before shooting. Actually okay. Sound is very loud. Louder than all firecrackers you heard. Therefore target practice must wear earplugs. Once I forgot to wear earplugs for target practice. Ears rang directly after first shot. Ringing feeling only eliminated after a week.\nTarget practice itself actually not tiring. Most time at range waiting for others to finish shooting. And because range discipline stricter. Cannot chat cannot do other things. Very boring. Target practice more tiring is preparation work. Prior need to pick up gun from warehouse. Then check gun. Range is at Chenggong Ridge 302. Carry heavy rifle walk thirty minutes from barracks. Walk until tired. Finish shooting take team walk back. Check gun clear gun again. Then send gun at night. Sometimes have to queue gun sentry guard gun. Often waste whole day for shooting.\nIndividual Combat Individual combat is simulating really going to battlefield to fight. Considered more useful class. Boot camp receives rifleman training. And rifleman role is to annihilate enemy firepower on ground. And individual combat teaches everyone how to use alternating fire cover. Attack forward towards enemy.\nIndividual combat field looks like a forest. Then will arrange several stations. Each station will have several situations. Such as have barbed wire, have trench how to cover each other pass. When our side someone injured how to rescue him and send back. And when two armies engage how to charge forward. Among there will be very many report words to memorize. Remember also memorized for several days. Result actual assessment different from what everyone memorized. Ran through all individual combat in a mess.\nActually doing will have quite a lot parts need to lie on ground or crawl forward. Therefore be mentally prepared whole body covered with mud and strange bugs crawl on body. During assessment will also set up machine gun tower firing blank ammo and use TNT to simulate mortar. Scene very shocking. Can slightly feel battlefield situation.\nAssessment Last week of boot camp is assessment week. About three days will conduct assessment. Meaning of assessment is to test whether unit has combat ability. Test includes physical fitness and combat skills. Physical fitness is push-ups, sit-ups and 3000 meters. Combat skills is bayonet charge, grenade, individual combat and target practice. Assessment doing things just doing things done in training class again. Just beside will have instructor from test center to supervise. Assessment officer will be stricter. Actually still going through a motion. After all five weeks time really hard to say every item practiced very skillfully. Officer also understands this. Therefore also doesn\u0026rsquo;t care too much about grades. Only care whether tried best to participate and whether order is good.\nAs for whether pass assessment makes any difference. One saying is pass will be easier to be call-up. But also some people say fail easier to call-up. Anyway just an urban legend. Only certain thing is assessment record will stay until unit, call-up until discharge. Later discovered by people assessment failed should be a bit shameful. So better try best to pass. As for physical fitness really cannot or really don\u0026rsquo;t want to sunburn there is exempt skill test move. Can find a chronic illness on body (flat feet, old injury, high blood pressure etc.) can go to National Army Hospital (Note not Tri-Service General Hospital nor Veterans General Hospital) open exempt skill test certificate. Haven\u0026rsquo;t heard anyone failed yet. Have exempt skill test certificate these three days just watch others skill test. Even more absolute can say body uncomfortable first day of assessment. Officer won\u0026rsquo;t force you must complete test. Anyway soldier is about honor.\nOfficial Duty During our boot camp other units preparing to renovate barracks. Need strictly large amount of people help move. Just happen obligatory service is cheapest labor. Therefore we have many opportunities to go on official duty. Boot camp stage official duty must go. Because not going is training class. Training class boredom level not as interesting as moving things. In addition official duty sometimes have welfare. Like vending machine, smoking, camp store etc. Also can take this opportunity to look at other places in camp area.\nDrawing Lots Don\u0026rsquo;t know from which batch phase two training need to go to other units. Then had this drawing lots link. Drawing lots everyone most afraid is drawing Golden Horse Prize. And current drawing lots system will first let people who really want to go to outlying islands volunteer priority. Remaining quota then let everyone draw. Surprisingly volunteer outlying islands registration quite enthusiastic. Probably think go only more than two months. Treat as working holiday in outlying islands should be nice. Except outlying islands. Maybe considering this batch all Taipei soldiers. Other lots almost all northern lots. Few farther ones like Hualien. Drawing lots link is everyone go up to lot cylinder draw a number plate. Someone will tell you drew what lot. More interesting is after drawing everyone ask each other what drew and find companion for next unit. Also somewhat sentimental. Drawing lots decided boot camp companions sharing weal and woe phase two training also separate. Phase two training compared to boot camp will be much relaxed. So actually most lots result actually similar. At most accommodation environment better or closer to home. I later drew Hsinchu Hukou Armored 584 Brigade. Already considered lot farther from Taipei. Later have chance write feeling about phase two training.\nReflection Say unreservedly boot camp is the most, most, most hard period of time in these four months. Still remember girlfriend suddenly confirmed diagnosed could not send me to serve army before enlistment. Let my every day next only spiritual pillar is time calling her public phone every day. Everyday besides solid training class make muscle sore. Next is just deprived freedom from free world instantly. Managed by others like elementary student. Really makes people doubt life. Doubt myself why waste four months managed by people. Regret why chose substitute service. In addition deprived mobile phone. Completely disjointed from outside information. What happened changed outside this month nothing can know. Lack of information very terrifying. Cannot contact girlfriend, family, friends moment to moment also makes people anxious. Also happen to approach election. What that candidate did said we also cannot know. Maybe because deprived freedom. Make people cherish value of freedom more. Cherish holiday time. Also warn myself don\u0026rsquo;t do bad things.\nAlthough officer management standard inconsistent, work efficiency extremely poor. Food terrible and often not enough to eat. This is still an unforgettable time. In hard times remember any interesting people things more. Without coming in to serve army might never know people of other backgrounds in society. Very hard to communicate with them without stereotype. And serving army broke barrier. Let me have broader understanding of this society. Now looking back. One month boot camp is absurd yet interesting. Boring yet meaningful.\nMe one week after enlistment\nBelow record some unforgettable people things in boot camp:\nUnforgettable Things 0600 Winter time is 6:00 wake up. Every day wake up duty squad leader will broadcast: \u0026ldquo;Current time 0600, Firepower Company wake up.\u0026rdquo;, this probably most unwanted sound for all new recruits. This means leaving dreamland. Get up wash fold mosquito net quilt. Welcome another boring day. It is said after discharge still some people subconsciously exist fear of Reveille. Hearing this sound still cannot help but nervous.\nFearing this sound not without reason. Boot camp stage quite a lot of people sleep not very well. Even 09:30 force everyone lie on bed. Still various reasons can make people can\u0026rsquo;t sleep. Like weather hot mosquito net hangs. Air conditioning or fan basically can\u0026rsquo;t blow in. Will make people hot to unable sleep. Also snoring sound of peer often annoying. Result actual sleeping time only left about five six hours.\nBench Military training service carry-on equipment besides helmet, S-belt, water bottle. Also one must carry is bench. Provided by our company is a plastic square bench. When marching can just jam body waist carry with left hand. Whether training class, listening lecture recruitment or going to restaurant eat bench is essential item. Otherwise you can only sit on ground. Therefore we self-mock bench is our real organic weapon. Worthy of First of Seven Weapons.\nBench makes people so impressive. Besides accompany us one month. Also commands related to bench. Like sitting bench cannot sit directly. Wait for squad leader command \u0026ldquo;Place bench\u0026rdquo;. Place bench behind heel hand touch bench look at squad leader. Hear \u0026ldquo;Good\u0026rdquo; then can sit. At this time definitely have fool haven\u0026rsquo;t heard good sit. Will be scolded by squad leader then back to previous move. Like this place bench game sometimes can play ten minutes.\nConfirmed Diagnosis In normal world accidentally confirmed diagnosed covid-19 might be very worried. Because quarantined several days (at that time quarantine seven days) cannot go out. However in army confirmed diagnosis basically like winning lottery. At this time army policy is once confirmed diagnosis go home isolate seven days until rapid test positive can return. In addition close contact of same bed also can isolate seven days. Can take seven days holiday who wants to stay in boring unit. Therefore every time collective rapid test pray self or same bed rapid test plate can appear two lines. And people who hit really cheer like winning lottery. Will definitely be scolded by squad leader. But going out to easy seven days. Who cares.\nHave to say army really is big virus den. More than one hundred people squeezed in small dormitory. Virus not spread also difficult. So first week appeared massive confirmed diagnosis. Plus same bed close contact about 60 people quarantined. My organic squad originally had 17 people. After first week only left five people including me. Originally thought 005 should be nothing related to squad leader. Result 001-004 all quarantined. I was forced to be squad leader more than week. Although squad leader also nothing to do. Since close contact will be quarantined. Someone in company originally close contact isolate seven days isolate finish find confirmed diagnosis isolate another seven days. Seven days later still not turn negative continue isolate. Result five weeks boot camp actual stay less than one week. Easy makes people envy.\nRice Not Enough Army food roughly junior high school nutritious lunch level. Won\u0026rsquo;t be hard to swallow but didn\u0026rsquo;t delicious to memorable. Compared to dish delicious or not everyone cares more is dish enough or not. Whole company has 150 people share that few five buckets of dish can be said monks many gruel little. Need someone strictly control everyone\u0026rsquo;s dish amount. Therefore also need special adding dish link let those appetite bigger add some dish eat fuller. However also often have fool steal dish when squad leader haven\u0026rsquo;t shouted add dish. Later of course scolded.\nLater weeks of boot camp. Dish not enough situation more and more serious. Not our appetite getting bigger. But kitchen share us less and less dish. Later less than half people serve dish gone. Therefore someone called 1985 because of this. 1985 is National Army complaint phone. Just to avoid officer misconduct after Hung Chung-chiu incident. Once receive 1985 complaint. Superior officer must handle this matter. Therefore sometimes used as one of means revenge officer. Because dish not enough call 1985 also have this meaning. Therefore day of incident officer also agreed take us to camp store supplement nutrition. Later this matter went to brigade headquarters. Even brigade political warfare director came to concern this matter. He probably thought very baffling even this kind of matter call 1985. Or say \u0026ldquo;This is normal channel reflecting situation\u0026rdquo;. But still hope we can first reflect to company officer. They probably also think this kind of matter annoying.\nHoliday Return Serving army most unforgettable probably holiday return time. Holiday rejoice self about to obtain short freedom time. RETURN lament why holiday passed so fast. And return with peer also make this matter become more interesting. Since High Speed Rail station to camp area take taxi. Peers often agree meet at High Speed Rail station. Eat Mos Burger or McDonald together. Enjoy last freedom time. Then take taxi. Walk into most unwanted return Chenggong Ridge camp area. On road everyone chat what played what ate during holiday. Then guess next week whether happy or painful. Outside everyone more or less have a career. Back to camp area just left a number. This transition road someone accompany also not that painful.\nDropping Chopsticks Boot camp stage up down restaurant collective lead team. In marching process as long as someone drops chopsticks. Sound will be very loud. At this time everyone knows someone chopsticks dropped. Interesting is from first day of boot camp to last day always someone cannot hold chopsticks well. Looks like Chenggong Ridge should think a way let everyone chopsticks not drop.\nSquad Leader Emotional Blackmail Squad leader also human. Some squad leaders mood not good and glass heart. Boot camp time very short. And teach many assessment items. For squad leader already collapse enough. Among individual combat is hardest subject. Teach time only two mornings. Content very much. And squad leader teach very tired new recruits listen not listen. Teach second day squad leader probably teach very unhappy. Just directly said he doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to teach ran to smoke. Later scolded by duty officer plus prone on ground prone thirty minutes. Squad leader willing continue come back teach finish. Naturally learning effect very poor. Assessment everyone running randomly.\nConstipation Army environment very magical. Once come in several days won\u0026rsquo;t want poop. Probably because army life too tight. Anytime wary whether accidentally miss assembly time. Under time pressure stomach probably not dare arbitrary. In addition no mobile phone accompany stomach not want work. At least these few weeks in boot camp times poop in camp area countable with fingers. Still comfortable poop at home.\nUnforgettable People Since our squad too many people quarantined. Left five people have feeling sympathize with each other. Therefore first familiar with this group. Probably because this batch all Taipei soldiers. Most soldiers family background very good. Degree also very good. Have gangster but quantity compared other batches should be much less. Below record some unforgettable peers: Internal Affairs Fool Every unit definitely has fool exist. And our company same no exception. Most impressive is a certain fool internal affairs untidy let officer temper blow up event. Everyone living habit different. Someone likes tidy link. Someone used to chaotic environment. If happen not good at organizing. Then in army really very painful. That fool is member of rice squad. Usually rest time compared average person came less. Therefore didn\u0026rsquo;t organize internal affairs much. Helmet put randomly. Yellow Pu bag whole bag exposed outside bed. Quilt not folded inside still run out. Messy until same bed cannot stand. Neighbor also cannot save him. Naturally scolded by squad leader. Plus confession letter one sheet. Later slightly improved. But compared others still failed.\nGangster Army includes people of all shades. Also include some only junior high school graduated. Body tattoo dragon phoenix or carry several criminal records. Also because these people discover voluntary service standard actually quite strict. People with above situation voluntary service not accept. Usually these people will gather together smoke. Considered birds of a feather flock together. Average person rare chance contact them.\nOnce official duty accidentally heard them chat nearby. Discussing each other why caught need often run court. One said drunk driving caught. Another said gathering brawl heavy injury. Also one drug trafficking caught. Caught because drug user controlled by police want to hang drug dealer out. Before discovered him strange still forced go buy. He said don\u0026rsquo;t sell people point gun at you. Listen them talk can feel this society maybe not as bright and beautiful as we see. Still exist many dark corners. Family background not good or know wrong people easy make people go wrong way. These things if not come in serve army. Probably lifetime won\u0026rsquo;t hear personally.\nSuper High Degree Peer I thought NTU EE CS master already considered very good degree. But this batch degree really exceeded my expectation. Our squad has 17 people. Inside contain two NTU medicine department and one TMU medicine department. Two NTU graduated. Other only two people no university degree. If promotion is random sampling then really quite big deviation. Again explain Taipei soldier family background good. Also value education.\nPeer Cannot Write Chinese Besides high degree peer. Also quite a lot people have study abroad experience. In our squad five people have study abroad experience. Someone high school go Germany exchange. Someone go study Lausanne Management Institute. Also someone go abroad research and study dentistry. More special is one from small study international school in Shanghai (heard therefore investigated background) then university go US study ABC. Although can speak Chinese but completely cannot read write Chinese. Therefore we need often help him translate translate. Besides often hear him talk about US things and discuss longing want go work in US in future. Let me also know quite a lot information during this period.\nConclusion One month plus boot camp. Days like years inside. Now look actually tooth bite passed. Later might still miss time chat all night with same bed. Sweat bayonet charge together. Complain officer days. Maybe because all wasting time doing same thing. If want me go again I certainly unwilling. Just entered still set many goals for self. Like physical fitness better. Weight lighter etc. After few days change mind live cool more important. Next batch after we left. Same unit had military training service accident. Now feel can safe discharge is luck\u0026hellip;.\nGoodbye Chenggong Ridge~\n","date":"2022-12-13T13:32:31+08:00","image":"https://i.imgur.com/T828STy.jpg","permalink":"https://www.hugoshih.com/p/chenggong-ridge-158t-101-brigade-4th-battalion-boot-camp-reflection/","title":"Chenggong Ridge 158T 101 Brigade 4th Battalion Boot Camp Reflection"},{"content":"A Google Interview Experience of an Ordinary Person Preface During my university years, AI technology was developing hotly. Therefore, there were frequent media reports about Google\u0026rsquo;s working environment, the leader of AI technology. Playground-like offices, endless snacks and drinks, five-star free meals, earning a million-dollar annual salary and sleeping whenever you want. Its internal fantasy refreshed my worldview of a job. Since then, I gradually became curious about this company. Although curious, I always held a wait-and-see attitude. The standard for admitting people to such a dream enterprise is naturally abnormally high. Ideally, they only accept bookworm gods or competition players from NTU EE/CS. Looking at my miserable school grades, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t imagine how to get a ticket to Google.\nIn my senior year, the department opened a corporate visit. The location was the Google I dreamed of. I signed up without hesitation, thus opening the fate of my first encounter with Google. At that time, the headquarters in Banqiao had not yet been established. We visited the headquarters located in 101. As the elevator to the 76th floor rose rapidly, the excitement was hard to suppress. The moment the elevator doors opened, I was greeted by the dream kingdom I dreamed of. It turned out that what the news said was true: free ice cream, free drinks, free five-star meals, coupled with the high-altitude view from the 76th floor, it really felt like a vacation. The amusement equipment and nap rooms were also real, fully reflecting Google\u0026rsquo;s trust in employees. After communicating with the employees leading us, I learned about the freedom of Google\u0026rsquo;s employee management. It is not only freedom in working hours, but employees also have considerable dominance over work items. Employees can even form small groups to initiate projects. Thus ended the first encounter with Google in shock. Since then, entering Google became my dream. I knew my shortcomings deeply and could only move towards there step by step. During the summer vacation of my senior year, I had an opportunity to go to San Francisco, USA. Taking this opportunity, I visited the dream place in my heart again, Google headquarters in Mountain View. However, this time it was a pity that I didn\u0026rsquo;t have connections to take me inside for a visit. I could only wander around the campus as a tourist. Although I could only look from the outside, I could feel the atmosphere of the entire company centered on Have Fun. Bicycles, beach volleyball courts, and various picnic areas everywhere were simply a large resort. Later I also went to the souvenir center near the campus to buy a lot of souvenirs. The pilgrimage trip made me feel the charming vitality of this company and the charm of Silicon Valley, the legendary place of the technology industry. With the creativity here and the changes brought to the world, I thought to myself that one day in the future, I also hope to come here to work. After returning to Taiwan, I entered graduate school. Originally, I didn\u0026rsquo;t have much confidence in my technical ability. After entering graduate school, I was surrounded by powerful people from all walks of life, which made me feel deeply that there is still a long way to go to enter Google. I must have a higher level of accumulation in technical ability and research ability. Holding this mentality, while being chased by research progress, I also participated in various side projects and hackathons as much as possible. I also participated in several startup projects and accumulated some experience in participating in startups. Amidst stumbling mixed with extraordinary luck, in the last year of graduate school, I was extremely lucky to get an internship opportunity at Microsoft, starting a year of life running between internship and graduate school. Although this old software company is slightly inferior to popular internet companies like Google and Facebook, as an old but evergreen tech giant, it still provided me with a lot of growth nutrients. The improvement of development technical ability and the cultivation of project management ability also allowed me to glimpse the life mode in technology companies.\nIn 2021, Google in Banqiao was established, which will be the largest hardware R\u0026amp;D center in Asia. What can be expected is that Google will have large-scale talent recruitment activities in Taiwan, and the difficulty of entering Google will be slightly easier than before. I deeply knew that this was a very good opportunity to enter Google. At the end of 2021, I received an interview invitation from Google HR on Linkedin for the first time. After interviewing with HR, I learned that this was a Hardware Engineer vacancy under Google Silicon, recruiting engineers with EE background or hardware development experience in Taiwan. It\u0026rsquo;s a pity that I had never learned hardware design and knew nothing about verilog. There was no follow-up news after the interview\u0026hellip;\nIn early 2022, heard that a junior schoolmate entered Google. I cheekily asked him to help refer me and applied for the 2022 Software Engineer Campus Recruitment. This time I was finally not shut out and successfully got the opportunity for the first interview. Thus began the devil-level interview challenge journey.\nBackground Bachelor\u0026rsquo;s in Information Management double major in Forestry from NTU + Master\u0026rsquo;s from NTU Telecommunication Engineering. Never participated in programming competitions, nor contributed to open source projects. Only did Side Projects and Hackathons with a few friends. Failed Programming Design in sophomore year because spent too much time in clubs, retook it in junior year and passed with A+. Data Structures and Algorithms were only at an ordinary level.\nPreparation Started grinding questions around December 2021. There was a period in between rushing research progress and wasting some time during Chinese New Year. After the New Year, to force myself to grind questions, I bought a one-year Leetcode Premium. It seems to be a very good investment now. In addition, I also bought the widely recommended Cracking the coding interview, but only read one or two chapters I wasn\u0026rsquo;t familiar with. My strategy for grinding questions in the early stage was starting from Dynamic Programming. At that time, I watched Huahua Jiang\u0026rsquo;s Dynamic Programming Ultimate Learning Strategy series videos to accumulate skills in thinking about DP problems. Around February, I started aiming to finish the first 100 Leetcode questions, starting from Easy, then Medium. In March, I started aiming to finish Blind 75. After finishing Blind 75 once, I went to look at the Hard questions in the first 100 questions. Finally, in the week before Onsite, I worked hard to grind Google interview high-frequency questions. I have to say Leetcode Premium organizing high-frequency questions is really convenient (and really quite useful XD). During this period, I would go up and write Daily every day, counting as forcing myself to maintain the feeling of solving problem every day. The number of questions ground was about 150 before Phone Interview, and about 230 before Onsite. Compared to various gods, it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be considered much, but for myself it was enough. All types of questions were covered. My feeling was that I could stably solve Medium, and could come up with feasible solutions for Hard. It\u0026rsquo;s a pity that I didn\u0026rsquo;t find friends to help Mock interview during this time. The accumulation of interview experience relied on actual combat accumulation. Before this, I also interviewed with Amazon and Nvidia. Because Google\u0026rsquo;s Technical Interview will have at least two rounds of all-English interviews, English is also a very important part. Although it doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to be as fluent as a Native speaker, at least the logic must be conveyed correctly. My English part mainly relied on what I accumulated during the internship, including daily chat terms and ability to explain technology. I am very grateful to people who were willing to communicate with me and practice English with me during this time. Record of grinding questions during this period\nStats of grinding questions\nTimeline 2022/01/20 -\u0026gt; Received friend\u0026rsquo;s referral notification email, submitted resume on official website, applied for Software Engineer, University Graduate, 2022 2022/03/07 -\u0026gt; Received email from HR notifying interview arrangement 2022/03/28 -\u0026gt; Phone Interview 2022/04/07 -\u0026gt; Notified passing Phone Interview, preparing to arrange Virtual Onsite Interview 2022/04/25 -\u0026gt; First day Virtual Onsite Interview, two rounds Technical Interview + one round Behavior Interview 2022/04/26 -\u0026gt; Second day Virtual Onsite Interview, two rounds Technical Interview 2022/05/07 -\u0026gt; Notified interview result most on positive 2022/05/26 -\u0026gt; Learned that Hiring policy might change\nProcess To say what needs most attention in the interview, I would feel it is to maintain a normal heart. This is also what I think is the most difficult part of the interview. After all, interviewing with your dream company, mixed emotions of excitement, expectation, nervousness etc., it is difficult to maintain a normal heart. During the first Phone Interview, I was even too nervous to sleep for the two nights before. What I could do was go to Youtube to find various videos of foreigners talking about software engineer interviews to watch, reminding myself of points to pay attention to in the interview. English ones could also practice English listening by the way. Here are a few recommended videos:\nInterview Process Analysis, explaining software engineer interview in SOP way, simple \u0026amp; easy to understand Google Technical Interview Experience Sharing, this one explains the interview process and precautions very carefully, very valuable for reference How to tech interview Like a Pro, this presents the process of coding interview in a funny way, quite interesting Phone Interview I sat in front of the computer waiting about ten minutes before the scheduled time. However, the interviewer hadn\u0026rsquo;t come online when I clicked in at the scheduled time, which made me nervous thinking if I remembered the time wrong. After waiting for about ten minutes, the interviewer finally came, apologizing that a previous meeting delayed a bit. The interviewer was actually a kind Chinese young lady. Initially she asked a problem similar to string comparison, about Easy level. Basically I thought of the solution as soon as I saw the question. After stating the solution, the interviewer also agreed with this solution, so I spent about 10 minutes finishing coding this question. Then she indicated there was a Follow up, more like using the concept of the first question repeatedly, belonging to Medium level. When thinking about this question, I originally thought I just needed to reuse the solution of the first question, but found that my solution used in the first question was not the optimal solution. I panicked a bit here. Fortunately, the young lady was very nice, constantly guiding me to think of a better solution. Finally I came up with a better solution and spent a few minutes implementing it. Before the interview ended, the young lady indicated there was actually a better solution, so used another few minutes to ask for advice, but she indicated she hadn\u0026rsquo;t thought of this solution herself either. Personal evaluation: overall interview performance was okay, problem solving wasn\u0026rsquo;t very fluent, got stuck in the middle, but solved it, so not bad. Later passed this round of interview.\nOnsite Interview Technical Interview #1 This round was a very nice Chinese uncle, didn\u0026rsquo;t arrive late either. Asked a variation of sorting problem. Initially thought it was Easy, but after actually solving it found it had Medium difficulty. Completely underestimated the depth of this question. Proposed a feasible solution at the very beginning, but the interviewer hoped I propose the optimal solution. Just like this, in the 30min of discussing solution, I proposed at least five or six solutions, and analyzed the difference in complexity under different input ranges, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t propose the optimal solution. Later with the interviewer\u0026rsquo;s hint I came up with the optimal solution, but time was basically used up. I could only quickly implement the idea. Later thinking back, the algorithm I implemented had Bugs. Fortunately the interviewer was very nice, didn\u0026rsquo;t rush to end the interview, instead tried to leave as much time as possible for me to finish the interview. Finally the interviewer responded that he thought this was a very interesting discussion, and thought I proposed many interesting ideas. With the experience of Phone Interview, I didn\u0026rsquo;t feel less nervous, instead was constantly worried the interviewer would come with a Hard question right away. In terms of the interview situation, I felt my performance was relatively terrible.\nTechnical Interview #2 This round was a young guy too lazy to talk. Asked a question similar to finding substring. He first asked me to think of a brute force solution. I basically had an idea and gave the solution right after reading the question. After he listened, he felt okay so asked me to implement. I spent about ten minutes implementing and explained the time complexity. Then he hoped I propose the optimal solution. I actually wasn\u0026rsquo;t confident about the optimal solution, only felt strings should be handled with prefix tree. So I proposed my idea. Unexpectedly he responded this was the correct line of thought. So continuing thinking I gave the optimal solution. Finished this round quite smoothly. Difficulty was about Medium. After bombing the first round, the mood in this round was much more relaxed. A bit of a \u0026ldquo;whatever\u0026rdquo; feeling. Probably because the mood was relaxed a lot, thoughts were clearer. Sure enough, nervousness is the big devil.\nBehavior Interview This round was a Chinese sister interviewing. First asked some quite common Behavior questions like team cooperation and how to communicate. Detailed questions have detailed info online. More surprisingly, the interviewer asked a question somewhat similar to product design. Because I completely didn\u0026rsquo;t anticipate this beforehand, I could only answer by imagination. But felt the interviewer didn\u0026rsquo;t seem very satisfied. At the end of the interview, gave a feedback thinking my answer wasn\u0026rsquo;t very deep, but she thought I might lack work experience, so not answering deeply was also within expectation. Overall answering was acceptable, at least gave steady and moderate answers.\nTechnical Interview #3 Starting from the third round it became English interview. The interviewer was still a Chinese guy. Have to say communicating in English with someone whose mother tongue is also Chinese is really much lower difficulty. Maybe because the thinking behind is still stuck in Chinese framework. The interviewer asked a tree traverse and output path question, highly similar to a Google high-frequency question on leetcode. Just happened to write it when grinding questions a few days ago. Almost instantly thought of optimal solution. Of course seeing original question was very exciting. Spent about 15 minutes explaining and finishing coding. Then the interviewer gave me a follow up. Superficially it was an extension of the above question, but actually already transformed into BFS finding shortest path between two points question. Quite an interesting Follow up. This variation couldn\u0026rsquo;t be found on leetcode. This question was also medium difficulty.\nTechnical Interview #4 The fourth round was a Chinese guy without much expression. Asked a question similar to blind 75 pacific atlantic water flow. First reaction after reading question linked to this blind 75 question. Afterwards also proved using same method could solve this question. Spent about 20 minutes explaining and finishing code. Then interviewer also gave a follow-up. But this follow-up wasn\u0026rsquo;t as interesting as previous round, just simple increase in quantity. Solved by modifying code slightly using same method. This question difficulty about Medium. Result was instead this interviewer thought the code I wrote had slight flaws. Sure enough, seeing familiar questions still cannot be too careless.\nFollow-up My interview time was valid as the tail end of Google 2022 Campus Hire. Most vacancies were already filled. So later it became directly no Headcount to proceed with Team match. So at that time I was mentally prepared to wait until next year\u0026rsquo;s campus hire to continue.\nLater as everyone saw, under the pressure of US interest rate hikes, major companies began to be forced to streamline manpower. The campus hire in Taiwan was also delayed until November to start, and headcount would have to wait until early next year after manpower policy is confirmed to be more certain. Fortunately interview results can be kept for one year. Just pray next year there are still opportunities to continue the interview process.\nAlthough I haven\u0026rsquo;t successfully entered my Dream company, I am still very grateful for opportunities and help provided by many people along the way. Also thanks to the Google HR assisting me for tirelessly providing various info on recruitment process.\n","date":"2022-12-05T09:00:18+08:00","image":"https://i.imgur.com/N6UT0BQ.jpg","permalink":"https://www.hugoshih.com/p/2022-google-taiwan-swe-interview-journey/","title":"2022 Google Taiwan SWE Interview Journey"},{"content":"Playing with Vintage Lenses - Leica Summicron-C 40mm f2 Preface In this era, poor students who want to play with the M system have many choices. Cheap and affordable 7Artisans, TTArtisan; diverse choices of Voigtländer; Zeiss whose image quality is not inferior to Leica at all; there are even flocks of ancient times M mount, L39 mount vintage lenses to choose from. Most 50mm focal lengths can be collected for just over 10,000, each is very good, each is full of stories.\nOne rainy afternoon in 2020, nesting in the darkroom developing films, while exchanging equipment with other club members. I still remember a friend mysteriously took out his Leica M3 from his bag for me to touch. That heavy feel, solid shutter, suddenly understood why it is said once touched cannot go back. For several nights after going back, I was always thinking about this camera. Before long, I also bought the first Leica film camera in my life. Just buying it spent most of my savings. Could only casually get a 7Artisans 35mm f2 to fill hunger. Even though outsiders say how high the CP value of this lens is, heart was still very unsatisfied. And indeed photos taken were also very ordinary. Used Leica body, anyway have to match a Leica original lens. At least I want to experience what is called \u0026ldquo;German flavor\u0026rdquo; what is called Leica aesthetics.\nLater encountered this Leica Summicron-C 40mm f2 on online trading platform. Condition not considered too good, paint loss coating scratches etc. problems all exist. Price therefore not too expensive, impression is around 14,000. Honest German made, Leica design.\nIntroduction This lens originally took a low price route. Mainly designed for use with Leica\u0026rsquo;s M system budget model Leica CL at that time. Leica CL is also a camera with quite a story. In Leica\u0026rsquo;s most desolate era, cooperated with Minolta to produce body with more electronic parts to attract users. Coping to let more people feel charm of Leica and purchase other Leica products. Result public instead only willing to purchase lower priced Leica CL and not willing to purchase Leica M5 at that time. Had to let Leica discontinue this camera early. And Summicron-C 40mm also only produced for few generations with camera then discontinued. Although said only produced for few generations, but production volume still quite large. Still considered easy to see on market today. Smaller body compared to other M models also makes many people love.\n[1]\nAlthough said budget model, but imaging of this Summicron-C 40mm is still not bad. Also considered comparable to other standard lenses of Leica at that time. Therefore everyone would rather buy this budget model. Materials of this lens are also comparable to other Leica lenses. Specifications as follows:\nNumber: 11542 Production Years: 1973-1979 Quantity: 54,350 Mount: M mount Lens: 6 elements in 4 groups Aperture: f/2 - f/16, 10 blades Weight: 120g Speaking of this lens, some people will call it Small Seven Elements or Poor Man\u0026rsquo;s Seven Elements. Nothing but similar focal length seeking a good name. But personally think there is still quite a gap with real Seven Elements. To say closer should be Leica Six Elements. Two lenses both are Double Gauss 6 elements in 4 groups structure. Production years also very close (1971-1979). In coating technology should also be very close. Except focal length difference two lenses actually very similar. Just pity Six Elements always jokingly called cost down version of Eight Elements after all lacking 2 elements. And produced in Leica\u0026rsquo;s most desolate era. Back to Summicron-C 40mm. Using 1/2 price of Six Elements to buy optical comparable to Six Elements. Doesn\u0026rsquo;t it smell good? The C on nameplate marked its fate. Hard not to let people think of Cheap. Just like iPhone 5c (people who can say this phone seem not young anymore).\n[2] Volume is also big advantage of this lens. This lens can completely be called pancake lens. Volume even smaller than those Color-Skopar lenses produced by Voigtländer. And and and also have f2 aperture. As far as I know, this should also be smallest Summicron lens in Leica lens group. Have to admire Leica\u0026rsquo;s ability to play with Double Gauss structure.\nBecause it is too excellent (too similar to Six Elements). Leica had to do a little modification to it. One is filter thread although same 39mm but cannot use normal 39mm filter but use special S5.5 pitch filter. But want force generic 39mm filter also can. Just might damage screw thread. Or cannot take down. In addition this lens also matched with hood. But is rubber made retractable hood. Maybe convenient but really ugly. When I collected lens didn\u0026rsquo;t attach this hood. If have I probably won\u0026rsquo;t install either. Later found a replica Leica hood install on. Appearance looks decent. I am a person won\u0026rsquo;t use lens cap if have hood. Forgetting to take down lens cap on rangefinder camera really nightmare. Having hood somewhat can prevent me touching lens.\nAnother difference is mount. If this lens installed on M body will automatically bring out 50mm frameline. One saying is small mechanism Leica made to make this lens harder use on M body. However this small mechanism can be avoided through a little manual work. That is grind off bottom lug in picture a little can let it bring out 35mm frameline. Leica\u0026rsquo;s 35mm frameline is closer to 40mm focal length. Therefore having 35mm frameline will be much convenient.\nOther differences like focus tab different from traditional crescent changed to a peculiar triangle. Aperture ring carries a little damping. However each Leica lens aperture feel not quite same. Even same series lenses have little gap. Worthy of purely hand assembled and tuned lens. Next lets see how this lens actually shoots.\nSample Shots First use Portra take few shots. Try how strongest negative film performs Can discover under sufficient light condition. Lens sharpness, bokeh basically no need worry\nPortrait performance under low light still very good. Can note when aperture fully open. Small halo will appear in bright parts. May come from defect of coating technology in that era. Some people also call Holy Light.\nUse valvia 100f take few more. Try performance on positive film Indoor performance also very good. Color thick flavor\nChange scene try how landscape Finally landscape on Provia 100f positive film\nConclusion As my first Leica lens. It accompanied me walk through many places. I also used it record many memories. Have to say it is a good lens. Also let me know Leica aesthetics through it. But it also has slight drawbacks. Like not near not far 40mm focal length, Holy Light etc. Later after acquiring Summicron-M 35mm ASPH resold Summicron-C 40mm. After all optical performance of two still has large gap. Still look forward one day in future have chance buy back this lens full of memories for me.\nReference [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leica_CL [2] http://www.l-camera-forum.com/leica-wiki.en/index.php/35mm_f/2_Summicron_III ","date":"2022-07-22T14:52:00+08:00","image":"https://i.imgur.com/rx11Znm.jpg","permalink":"https://www.hugoshih.com/p/playing-with-vintage-lenses-leica-summicron-c-40mm-f2/","title":"Playing with Vintage Lenses - Leica Summicron-C 40mm f2"},{"content":"Mechanical Camera Series - Hasselblad A12 Magazine Loading Method Preface A while ago, I was pushed into the pit by a friend and bought a Hasselblad 500cm + CB 60mm 3.5f. As a medium format film SLR camera, the exquisiteness of its mechanical structure goes without saying. Even if not taking it out, playing with it in hands is still very enjoyable. Looking through the viewfinder, the optical beauty of Zeiss is revealed completely. The only drawback is that the huge body and weight are really inconvenient to take out. Bought it for a while but it has been kept in the dry box by me. Recently, I finally made up my mind to use it to take good photos. On a whim, I recorded how to use the Hasselblad A12 magazine to change film. For a novice using Hasselblad photography for the first time, I was surprised to find that there are many details to pay attention to. It is completely unlike 135 film cameras which are brainless. One careless mistake may destroy a roll of film and 12 hard-earned photographic works.\nA black painted Hasselblad 500cm collected from an old master. Most people's impression of Hasselblad is the silver stainless steel outer edge, which has the beauty of classical crafts. The all-black Hasselblad has a modern feel and is more low-key. CB 60mm 3.5f was purchased from Pinkuan Photography. Originally wanted to match a mediocre 80mm, but the price of 80mm on the market was too scary at that time. CB 60mm is a high CP value choice. Sharpness and distortion are perfect. The viewing angle is also close to the 35mm lens of 135 format, but the actual shooting perspective is completely different.\nStart Loading Film Remove Magazine First thing to do is remove the magazine from the body. Slide the round button on the magazine to the left side of the picture to unlock the latch and remove the magazine. Note that if the dark slide is not inserted back into the magazine, the latch cannot be moved. Forcing it may cause mechanical damage. After removing the magazine, be careful not to touch the two door-like light shields behind the body, otherwise damaging them causing light leakage will not be fun.\nPull Out Magazine Insert Next, take out the magazine insert inside. But before taking it out, be sure to check if there is still film inside. If there is, confirm if it has finished rewinding. If you rashly take out the magazine insert, it will cause the film inside to be exposed to light, which would be miserable. Then just turn the knob on one side of the magazine from the left appearance to the right appearance and pull outward to pull out the magazine insert. Sometimes it may not be pulled out, mostly because the dark slide is inserted backwards and stuck the magazine insert, so remember the dark slide also has directionality.\nExchange Spool The extracted magazine insert looks like this. The one originally on the left is the old spool, which needs to be moved to the right. So don\u0026rsquo;t lose the old spool. If lost, you can only go to ask film developing shop for one. After Hasselblad magazine finishes shooting, it will rewind the film to the old spool, so every time the spool of the last film shot will be left.\nFilm Today I am loading Kodak\u0026rsquo;s Portra 400 film. This roll should be one of the few satisfying films in the era of diminishing film types. Color latitude and detail are much better than the new Gold 200, and 400 ISO can provide relatively higher shutter speed. Except for the high price, it should be the first choice for 120 color.\nAfter opening the 120 film package, need to tear off the paper seal outside the film. The pulled out section is actually not film but backing paper, which is the biggest difference between 120 film and 135 film. Because 120 film has no shell, to prevent accidental exposure of film, need to rely on backing paper for light shielding. The real film is sandwiched in the middle of backing paper. Pulling to a certain position will pull out the real film together. The real film and backing paper are stuck together with a piece of paper tape. For detailed structure, can refer to this article: 120 Film Structure.\nInstall Film First we install the film to the right side where the spool was originally placed. Please note the direction the backing paper is pulled out, it is pulled out from below. Do not install the film direction backwards. Then pull the backing paper to the back of the magazine insert.\nAfter wrapping the backing paper to the back, please note that there is a structure on the magazine insert for clamping the backing paper. This structure is clamped tight when the magazine insert is pulled out. We need to turn the knob of the magazine insert back to the original position first so that this backing paper clamping structure will loosen, making it convenient for the backing paper to pass from below.\nAfter the backing paper passes, turn the knob of the magazine insert back to the open state, this structure will clamp the backing paper again.\nPass the end of the backing paper through the hole in the center of the old spool.\nFinally we rotate the knob below the spool on the other side to tighten the backing paper. Continue rotating until the START arrow (not necessarily have START) appears on the new film side. This arrow will align with the red arrow on the magazine. This completes the film installation.\nReinstall Magazine Insert When reinstalling please note the position of the magazine insert knob. Need to tighten the backing paper clamping mechanism so the magazine insert can be installed into the magazine. After installing, turn the knob back to original position to complete magazine insert installation.\nHasselblad magazine needs to pre-roll film to the last frame. Can be understood as Hasselblad magazine starts shooting from the last frame. Therefore need to rotate the crank on the other side of magazine until the number 1 appears in the small window at the bottom left of magazine.\nFinally install the magazine back to the body and can start shooting. Remember to confirm the body is already cocked when installing back to body, otherwise installing magazine then cocking will make film shoot one less frame.\nRemember to pull out magazine dark slide when shooting, otherwise shutter cannot be pressed.\nPicture looking through viewfinder, Zeiss optical imaging is really beautiful.\nSample Shots Attach some Portra 400 sample shots for reference, processed by Violet\nNew Google Building under construction in Far Eastern Software Park Logo at Google Banqiao Office Entrance Google Banqiao Building Second Floor Restaurant downstairs of Google Office Small road from Neihu to Yehliu View from Fengguizui Some Tips for A12 Magazine A12 Magazine Stealing 13 Frames Magazine Serial Number Inconsistent ","date":"2022-07-11T17:10:00+08:00","image":"https://i.imgur.com/e1gynu4.jpg","permalink":"https://www.hugoshih.com/p/mechanical-camera-series-hasselblad-a12-magazine-loading-method/","title":"Mechanical Camera Series - Hasselblad A12 Magazine Loading Method"},{"content":"Docker Usage Notes Preface Docker can be said to be a very important project in cloud technology.

Different from the nervousness when I was a stage crew, a performer, or a core cadre watching Magic Night. I was once again moved by this magical evening. Recalling when I first stepped into the club class in my freshman year, watching Ding Hao perform circus tricks. In a blink of an eye, I am about to put on the graduation scarf. For four years, the Magic Club has been home, the center of life, and an inseparable part. So let\u0026rsquo;s summarize it with this reflection article.\nThe Road to Magic Night Origin The story began in high school when a senior from the Magic Club showed me a video of Hua Nei performing Le plus. The video played, and he talked endlessly: \u0026ldquo;In the distant NTU Magic Club, there is a group of very powerful magicians, and no one knows why they are so powerful.\u0026rdquo; This made me very curious. Later I learned that these people had been on the NTU Magic Night. What kind of stage is that? Is it really as powerful as the rumors?\n19th Magic Night \u0026ldquo;The League of Performers\u0026rdquo; The opportunity came quickly. In the winter vacation Magic is Concept event, I accidentally won two tickets for the 19th Magic Night. Then I lobbied Yong Chen and friends from the club to go watch together. In that environment where we could only watch Magic Talent Show to appreciate magic, NTU Magic Night showed me a new world of magic. Nine incredibly powerful performances and hosting that made people laugh from beginning to end. This is really amazing. I must stand on this stage one day.\n20th Magic Night \u0026ldquo;Lumos\u0026rdquo; In the second semester of third year high school, even though I became a college entrance exam warrior, I still got a ticket for the 20th Magic Night. Unfortunately, only half of the show was finished by 9:30, so I could only give up the idea of finishing Magic Night. Later I heard about various wonderful things in the second half, and I really regretted it. If I had known that the next time I could sit in the audience would be four years later, I would probably regret it even more QQ.\n21st Magic Night \u0026ldquo;21Hero\u0026rdquo; Then I muddle-headedly entered NTU. Muddle-headedly joined the NTU Magic Club. Muddle-headedly watched Yun Heng perform magic (Sorry Yun Heng QAQ, I often disappeared from club classes\u0026hellip;) Unknowingly, the time left for magic became less and less. Until one day I really believed that my passion for magic was probably just this much. Then Yong Chen suddenly told me he was asked to be a stage crew for Magic Night. He saw a lot of amazing things there. Out of curiosity, I later also applied to be a stage crew and was lucky enough to be selected. Stepping into the sacred place of the 2nd Activity Center, I saw many incredible things. What shocked me first was Yang Yi\u0026rsquo;s incredibly powerful performance. Followed by each performer, under the meticulous carving of the elders day and night, Evolving and transforming rapidly in a very short time, becoming amazingly cool performances. It made me believe again that becoming a performer for NTU Magic Night is not an unattainable dream.\n22nd Magic Night \u0026ldquo;Fantastical Beasts and Where to Find Them\u0026rdquo; Driven by the Magic Night syndrome, I took the teaching exam and accepted the baptism of being a cadre for a whole year. It can be considered as making up for the things I didn\u0026rsquo;t learn well when I was a freshman. Then hurriedly completed the selection process. After passing the selection, I wasted the time before the first verification, and started various Magic Night journeys of rushing progress. After the breakdown of the fifth verification, I finally completed a routine that I was reasonably satisfied with. Finally stood on the stage of NTU Magic Night, fulfilling the promise I made to myself in high school. There are too many people to thank along the way. First of all, I must thank the hard-working core cadres. Thank you for believing that I could go on Magic Night and giving me the opportunity.\nMing Han: Thank you for giving me many suggestions on aesthetics. Remember one day after the sixth verification when I was breaking down, you watched me finish the run and silently said: \u0026ldquo;Nice run\u0026rdquo;. At that moment, I really had the urge to burst into tears. Yun Heng: Thank you for giving me many suggestions on movements and lighting. Your strictness is definitely the driving force for our improvement. Zhang Teng: Thank you for helping me solve difficult problems with props, and thank you for often encouraging me and giving me spiritual support. Peng Ya: Thank you for often bringing a lot of food for us. Every time I see you coming, I feel redeemed. Xuan Bo: In the early stage of Magic Night when there was no direction, I almost used your performance as a template. Also thank you for tirelessly giving me many suggestions on costumes later. In the later stage of Magic Night, you also spent a lot of time helping me modify the routine. Without your help, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t have produced this routine. Yan Yan: Thank you for always giving encouragement at various times. Even though schoolwork is busy, you still made time to help me modify the routine, making my routine more and more like what I had in mind. Xiao Mei: After you modified it, there was always a feeling of sudden evolution. I really like the things you modified. Also thank you for teaching me many concepts of movement design, which are still useful today. Bo Cheng: A senior who helped me a lot in high school. Thank you for helping me solve various difficult problems with sleight of hand during Magic Night. Hua Nei: Idol during high school. Although I heard you are very strict, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t wait to ask you to help me modify the routine. Thank you for helping me pick out many flaws in movements, and also gave me many useful suggestions when deciding the direction in the early stage of the routine. Xiao Gui: Thank you for always being able to answer various questions in detail and comprehensively. The feedback given based on the video after each verification is also endlessly beneficial. Also thank you for solving some prop problems. En-Jui Shang: Idol number two during high school. Thank you for taking the time to help me modify the routine. You are as powerful as rumored, always able to elevate seemingly ordinary effects to another level. Zi Yuan: Thank you for often appearing in the 2nd Activity Center to watch me run the routine, and always being able to give a lot of suggestions after I finish running. Xiao Qiu: Thank you for always silently appearing in the 2nd Activity Center to watch us practice, and always tirelessly helping us solve various bugs in the routine. Ling Yu: Thank you for often coming to the 2nd Activity Center to give us encouragement. Yuan Ting: Thank you for giving me many suggestions in the early stage of the routine. Yang Yi: Thank you for giving me many out-of-the-box suggestions. Michael Yang: Thank you for giving me advice on props before the selection. Bai Cai: Thank you for taking the time to help me modify the routine. Jun Wei: Thank you for helping me when I couldn\u0026rsquo;t make props. Jin Hao: Thank you for researching various circuits with me, although it wasn\u0026rsquo;t used in the end QQ. Teacher Hsieh Kai Kai: Thank you for your energetic encouragement. Yu Ling: Thank you for often coming to the 2nd Activity Center to practice with us. When you are there, the 2nd Activity Center is always full of happy atmosphere. Yu Xian: Enthusiastically gave me many suggestions in the early stage of the routine. Everyone in the Teaching Group: Thank you for the various joys during each preview, which can always relieve the pressure during Magic Night. Yong Chen: It\u0026rsquo;s really great to know you. From encouraging each other to go on stage in high school, to helping each other to go on Magic Night in college. I have to say you really gave me a lot of motivation to go on Magic Night. Look forward to us continuing to shine in various aspects in the future. How Jiun Hsu: Thank you for being so carry as the teaching head. I also admire your endless ideas in magic. Chang Jin: Always put forward many ideas during previews. Xuan Yu: Thank you for always being so serious and hard-working, arousing the passion for magic. Jie Li: Thank you for your various jokes, which can always make people smile knowingly. Everyone in 22nd Magic Night: Thank you You Zeng, Weng Jun, De Yan (Good luck with BIMF), Davin Dai, Yan Ni, You Ren, Meng Hao, Qing Chen, Hao Ping. Because of you, the 22nd Magic Night could be so wonderful. Thank you to the many elders of NTU for your help, so that I could stand on the stage. I keep all the elders who have helped me in my heart. Only after experiencing Magic Night did I understand that fighting alone is not enough to support Magic Night. Magic Night is the crystallization of the collective wisdom of the elders. Less one point and it would not be so perfect.\n23rd Magic Night \u0026ldquo;Secret\u0026rdquo; Magic Night syndrome struck again, and I took over as a core cadre. Very grateful to the previous core cadres for believing that I was competent for this job. Being a core cadre was where I learned the most things in the Magic Club. Including various administrative affairs, crisis management. How to organize an event well, how to plan a good evening party. How to lead a group of performers, from knowing nothing to finally standing on the stage of NTU Magic Night. And the process is still to thank the help of many NTU elders.\nThanks to Core Cadre Partners President Hao Jun: Thank you for always being so carry and reassuring. All unsolvable problems seem to naturally have answers in your hands. Vice President Xuan Yu: Your delicate mind can always directly and neatly give performers spiritual or substantial assistance. Also thank you for undertaking the position of stage director without hesitation. Executive Secretary Yan Ni: Thank you for sparing no effort in handling administrative affairs. Also thank you for always being able to give performers spiritual encouragement. Thanks to Previous Core Cadres Yun Heng: Even though your schoolwork is busy, you still devoted a lot of time to the Magic Club. From giving performers opinions and helping performers complete routines, to various administrative problems. Without you, the 23rd Magic Night would not have been so smooth. Zhang Teng: Still thank you for various prop support, as well as various assistance with lighting control on the day of Magic Night. Without you, Magic Night would not be so good-looking. Ming Han: Thank you for assisting in the production of promotional materials, and helping to make the super handsome opening video. Peng Ya: Thank you for various administrative support. Thanks to Elders Who Often Come Back Pang Zi: Thank you for trying your best for the performers of this session. And your fried seaweed. Bai Cai: Thank you for often coming back to help supervise performers\u0026rsquo; practice. Xiao Qiu: Also thank you for often coming back to help supervise performers\u0026rsquo; practice. Yong Chen: You are like the fifth core cadre, assisting us everywhere. Thank you to all elders who took time out of their busy schedules to come back and assist performers. Without you, there would be no 23rd Magic Night. Teacher Kai Sheng: You are the guardian deity of NTU Magic Night. Finally, Congratulations to All Performers of the 23rd Magic Night Congratulations on achieving your goal and standing on the stage of NTU Magic Night. Thank you for your persistence.\nJian Hong: From a freshman who knew nothing, to a performer who can finally stand on stage alone. It is really gratifying to watch. Aaron: You are really a genius. You can always come up with many interesting interpretations yourself, and we don\u0026rsquo;t need to worry too much. Jia Li: Thank you for your persistent efforts. The final performance is worthy of your efforts and the help of the elders. Jin Xuan: You are definitely the most serious performer in the 23rd Magic Night. From the summer vacation to the practice before the selection, you have never been lazy. And your smooth performance still impresses me. Also a performer that core cadres don\u0026rsquo;t need to worry too much about. Zhong Han: Comedy role of 23rd Magic Night. Compared to cool magic, being funny probably suits you better. Your enthusiasm could be seen from the preparation for the selection. Very happy that you finally found the right way and exploded the whole audience. Yu Ling: Thank you for your love for the NTU Magic Club all along. Also congratulate you on finally completing a very wonderful performance that belongs to you. Lei Qiu: Thank you for your passion for magic all along. Also completed a quite powerful routine. Look forward to your development in the future. Qian Yu: Another genius. Your domineering air flows out naturally. Really amazing. Also thank you for holding up the finale position, and finally exploding the whole audience quite wonderfully. Hosts Yu Xiang, Jia Yi, Yan Yu, Sha Sha: Thank you for often staying up late to change the script, and racking your brains to come up with many very good jokes. You made me laugh from beginning to end on the day of Magic Night. It was really very good-looking. Whether being a core cadre is easy or not is a matter of opinion. But the pressure is certainly not small. After all, NTU Magic Night has always been known for its high standards, and now it is our turn to carry this pressure. But when seeing the final result, all the efforts are worth it.\n24th Magic Night \u0026ldquo;Magician and the ideal land\u0026rdquo; Unloaded the identity of a core cadre. Have more time to try things I want to try. Three years later, sitting in the audience again to appreciate NTU Magic Night. Returned to the excited and expectant mood when first learning magic. And the emotion after watching Magic Night lingered for a long time. Sure enough, only NTU Magic Night can surpass NTU Magic Night. NTU Magic Night is like a very long dream. After waking up from it, You will know it is time to face your life properly. Thank you to the core cadres of this session. Thank you Fu Miao, Shi Fu, Aaron, Yan Yu. Thank you for doing your best to support the club. Thank you to the performers of this session. Thank you for surviving various verifications and tests. Various hard work will turn into sweet fruits. Hope you all enjoyed this stage full of fantasy and charm. Thank you to all elders, Teacher Kai Sheng. We have completed such a good-looking evening party again.\nAcknowledgements Important people should always be placed last. Thank you parents Thank you for allowing me to devote time to the Magic Club. Even though for the sake of the Magic Club, I haven\u0026rsquo;t been home for dinner for a long time, haven\u0026rsquo;t talked to you properly for a long time. You never stopped me. Also thank you for providing me with resources within your limited ability, giving me the ability to try and challenge. No matter what, you are the people I should thank the most.\nThank you Jia Yi Thank you for always tolerating? me running to the Magic Club every now and then. Thank you for supporting me to focus on preparing for the performance when I was on Magic Night. Thank you for not resenting me for often asking you to come to practice when you were on Magic Night. Thank you for always supporting me and believing in me unconditionally. Thank you.\nThank you Hsing-Yu Shih Thank you for your strong heart. Thank you for your unyielding soul.\nFinally, thank you NTU Magic Club An initial curiosity, accidentally spent four years to explore. Seemed like a blink of an eye, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t short either. It\u0026rsquo;s really a wonderful journey.\n","date":"2019-05-19T16:50:00+08:00","image":"https://i.imgur.com/wlZs4Hc.jpg","permalink":"https://www.hugoshih.com/p/my-journey-to-ntu-magic-night/","title":"My Journey to NTU Magic Night"},{"content":"Datacube Function Note - Basic API Functions Can refer to this website: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/opendatacube/datacube-core/blob/develop/examples/notebooks/Datacube_Summary.ipynb Official function documentation: https://datacube-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_modules/index.html Adjusting image colors: http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/plotting.html Example package: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/opendatacube/datacube-core/tree/develop/examples/notebooks/ xarray usage: https://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/generated/xarray.Dataset.html#xarray.Dataset https://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/api.html#dataarray\nDatacube class: create a Datacube item, used when importing Datacube database 1 2 class datacube.Datacube(index=None, config=None, app=None, env=None, validate_connection=True) Example:\n1 2 3 4 import datacube dc = datacube.Datacube(app = \u0026#39;my_app\u0026#39;, config = \u0026#39;/home/localuser/.datacube.conf\u0026#39;) # Basically look at where the data is in the Datacube you use, suggest using directly Datacube.list_products() \u0026amp; Datacube.list_measurements() Datacube.list_products(): list all satellite data Datacube.list_measurements(): list band types contained in satellite data Example:\n1 2 3 4 5 list_of_products = dc.list_products() netCDF_products = list_of_products[list_of_products[\u0026#39;format\u0026#39;] == \u0026#39;NetCDF\u0026#39;] netCDF_products # Set list_of_products parameters as above, I don\u0026#39;t know the difference either # Prints out a table 1 2 3 list_of_measurements = dc.list_measurements() list_of_measurements # Can print directly, prints out a table too Datacube.load(): Create an xarray.Dataset to store various parameters of data to be fetched 1 2 3 4 Datacube.load(product = None, measurements = None, output_crs = None, resolution = None, resampling = None, dask_chunks = None, like = None, fuse_func = None, align = None, datasets = None, **query) Example 1:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 import datetime # define geographic boundaries in (min, max) format # Use two variables to store latitude and longitude range (box) to find, I don\u0026#39;t know how to use polygon lon = (120.3697, 120.5044) lat = (23.6686, 23.7476) # define date range boundaries in (min,max) format # Use datetime format to store time range for extracting data date_range =(datetime.datetime(2016,1,1), datetime.datetime(2017,6,30)) # define product and platform to specify our intent to #load Landsat 8 sr products platform = \u0026#39;LANDSAT_8\u0026#39; # Satellite data template, actually no need to type, if type don\u0026#39;t make mistake product = \u0026#39;ls8_lasrc_taiwan\u0026#39; # Used to identify which satellite data to read, absolutely cannot make mistake # define desired bands. desired_bands = [\u0026#39;red\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;green\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;blue\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;nir\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;swir1\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;swir2\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;pixel_qa\u0026#39;] # Band data to extract # For Landsat8 there are coastal_aerosol, blue, green, red, nir, swir1, swir2, # lwir1, lwir2, pixel_qa, sr_aerosol, radsat_qa bands, we only extracted some of them, can add more # Output order will appear according to arrangement in array # load area.
