&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Hello, my name is Hsing-Yu Shih (施星宇). I am currently working as a Firmware Engineer at Microsoft. I earned my master&amp;rsquo;s degree in EECS from National Taiwan University, where my area of specialization was Communication Engineering. My undergraduate studies were also completed at National Taiwan University, where I received a bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in information management with a double major in forestry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My passion is magic, and during my college years, I held the position of vice president in the magic club and was an active performer. My involvement in the club provided me the opportunity to learn prop-making techniques, and I have gained a wealth of experience as a Maker through my participation in the club.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>During my graduate studies, my research topic was the detection of suspicious accounts in online services, with a primary focus on data science, machine learning, and communication networks. Alongside my academic pursuits, I also participated in a photography club where I acquired knowledge of darkroom techniques and honed my photography skills.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the summer of 2021, I had the opportunity to intern at Microsoft, which allowed me to gain a better understanding of the development technology and work model of a technology giant. As I anticipate graduating in the summer of 2022, I began my job search journey. After a thorough process, I am excited to have returned to Microsoft and to begin my career as a Software Program Manager.&lt;/p>
