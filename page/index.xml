        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;about-me&#34;&gt;About Me&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi, My name is Hsing-Yu Shih(施星宇). I am currently a graduate student at Nationla Taiwan University and major in communication engineering. I have a bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree from National Taiwan University, majoring in information management with a double major in forestry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love magic, and I was the vice president of the magic club in college and participated in many performances. During the period of participating in the magic club, I learned the technique of making props and accumulated many Maker skills.&lt;/p&gt;

At the same time, I also joined a photography club to learn darkroom techniques and photography skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2021, I became an intern at Microsoft, which gave me a better understanding of the development technology and working model in the technology giant. In anticipation of graduating in the summer of 2022, I started my interview journey.&lt;/p&gt;
